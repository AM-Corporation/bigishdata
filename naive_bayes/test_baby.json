The backpack was delivered in less then a day! I checked it out to make sure I did not get a fake as that seems to be happening. So I made sure I ordered from a Amazon fulfillment center. I could have picked one from the hop skip website, it $20 but I needed (wanted it) by our next outing in a few days.My child is 15 months old and spends short amount of time (1.5hrs a week) at a gym daycare, and we go out shopping, story time etc and I did not need the whole fully stocked diaper bag. what was happening was leave the diaper bag in the car and hope we didn't need a change, then I started keeping a diaper, wipes and some snack pouches in my purse, this got old fast and I needed to leave those items with my kid and didn't want to leave my purse so after looking at solutions I decided this was the cutest backpack ever and my daughter can have it with us, it is not big and bulky like a diaper bag, but better then using my purse!As soon as it arrived I emptied all the baby stuff out of my purse/bag the backpack will hold diapers, wipes, a jacket, and more! I was concerned about it being too small as some people pointed out, but since we have 1.5 years before pre-school I thought it was worth the cost if we used it 3 times a week for a year+ and if it lasts into pre-school even better! I have a feeling that I will mostly be carrying the bag for her, My daughter wore it for a little while, the straps are very adjustable, they will fit a small toddler all the way to an adult.It says it comes with a snack pouch, I was a little disappointed to learn that the snack pack is just the front pocket. They should have called it a insulated snack pocket. Snack pouch sounded to me like something we could remove from the backpack, fill with snacks. But there is a matching lunch bag that I will get if we need meals on the go regularly. Right now this backpack is perfect for our needs. I am so happy I don't have to keep my kids stuff in my bag anymore. This is so much easier to carry.

I heard a lot about this chair on a forum I was part of.  I looked more into it and was very impressed myself.1) I like the slimmer design that seems to be accomplished by using steel instead of plastic.  This makes it heavier but I don't carry the seat around so I don't mind.2) IF you travel and need to take the car seat, the bottom folds up to make it flat.  This makes it easier to take onto planes and travel with.3) There are various openings in the seat where the fabric has velcro to hold it together.  This is so that you can easily gain access to the back of the seat to thread things through (the LATCH system is connected and needs to be thread through, if you use a seat belt, it needs to be threaded through, this makes it easier to do so).4) It has low sides.  For me, this is a plus.  I don't have to lift my children up high to get them in the seat (which in the past lead me to bump heads on the roof).  It also seems to make it easier for our oldest (3yrs) to get in and out of the seat on his own.5) The flap in the front has a pocket for storing emergency contact information.  It may seem a tad \"weird\" but it makes sense.  You can fill out the information and in the event of a bad accident, someone can use this information if you are unable to communicate.6) Did I mention they're slim?  I have a Toyota Rav4 and have 2 of these in the back and can still fit a grown adult in the back seat.  I have one seat attached via seat belt and the other using the LATCH.  Please keep in mind that in 2014 the rules for using the LATCH system is changing officially.  You should not use it if the combined weight of car seat and child is 65lbs or more.  This seat weighs in at 24lbs.  This means you should stop using the LATCH system when your child weighs 41lbs.  Our oldest was only 1 or 2 lbs shy when I was installing the new seat so I just went ahead and switched it ahead of time.7) The cup holder does not snap in but is stable for holding a cup.

Originally we intended to use a pack and play for cosleeping, but turns out baby didn't like that.  The cosleeper has been great in general though there are a few quirks about it.General Observations: Pro or Con depending on how you look at it.1. Height - so the standard height it comes at seems to work for traditional beds on shorter metal frames.  But for our pillowtop beds, its a few inches short.  You can buy extensions, but I recommend getting regular bed risers.  They're cheaper and we found a set at bed bath that fit the feet of the cosleeper exactly and brought the height right to our pillowtop beds.2. Portability - it does fold up small and everything packs back into the bag.  I'll say though it is a bit heavy for its size and the buttons to initiate the folding are behind fabric sleeves so it's easy to miss them even though the fabric has markings that say push here.  Also you have to do the fold in a special order (bottom first) or it won't work.  Bottom line is practice about two or three times and you'll have it down.Pros:1. Smaller size is great as our rooms aren't that big so it makes it easier to get around it in the middle of the night.2. Storage compartment underneath is awesome can take tons of stuff.  Just make sure you don't put things in there you need to access often.3. Wheels, the wheels on one side make it easy to move around the same floor, but if you're moving it to another level you should fold it or it's a two person job despite the size.  The wheels also lock so no worries about its rolling around on its own.4.Adjustable heights - you can adjust the hight at each of the four corners and we used this to tilt it slightly to help with baby's gas issues.  This might not be a good idea once he can start rolling around on his own.Cons:1. I guess you can't use it that long, but do you really want baby right next to you forever?2. It ain't that good looking, but then neither are you with a baby waking you up constantly.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "03 31, 2011", "summary": "Good first start, no frills."}

I love that you don't have so many pieces per bottle to wash like the Ventaire bottles. You only need to wash/sterilize the nipples, caps, and rings, which saves a new mom lots of time. The wide nipples do make it a little hard for the baby to latch on at first but they get used to it. I also like the drop ins because I know they are presterilized so I don't worry about the germs for my baby. The fact that the bags help reduce the air the baby intakes is also a bonus. This set is a great starter kit- it came with two sizes of bottles, the 4 oz for now and the 8 oz for when baby can drink larger amounts and also drop in liners.The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because the set only gives you 2 of each bottle size and if you are like me and like to premake a few bottles for convenience, you'll have to buy an additional set to get extra bottles. Also, the drop in liners do have one flaw - the ounce measurements on them are not colored so they blend in and are hard to see; I discovered that they are also inaccurate and are off by 1/2 ounce.

I like that it is a compact shade (see uploaded pic) that is the size of a frisbee and that the mesh is tighter than our mosquito net. While our mosquito net did a pretty good job when we used it, this appears that it will do much better. The sunshade part just pulls out of the red bag and snaps into place (see uploaded pic) while the stock photo makes it appear to be more permanent.One thing worth mentioning is that I find it just too much trouble for daily driving. I just toss a blanket over the carrier. I took him out to a Farmer's Market (in Indiana) for less than an hour and his back was soaked. I don't know if that is because of the carrier (have read similar complaints) or because this traps heat in. Our ideal uses for this are for when we will be outside with him for an extended period of time, going for a walk, or long car rides. We haven't used it to keep hands off of the baby because we haven't had the need to. We first took him to church at 3 weeks and we have had a lot of lookers but no one demanding to touch or that touches without asking. It would probably be good for that purpose for premies and babies born closer to winter, though.Very happy that it takes all of 5 second to pull out of the bag and form, about 10 more seconds to secure around the carrier, and about 5 more seconds to collapse and put back in the bag. Like other reviewers that I have seen, I will mention that on mine there is a small gap near the handle of the carrier where bugs could get in (because there is not a gap in the plastic between the handle and the carrier for the shade to slide into) but it is not a deal-breaker for me. Our carrier is a Chicco. Also, like others have said, I do not really like that the sides are completely unprotected from the sun. We travel directly west up to 10 hours (leaving in the morning) and back most of the times that we do travel. Therefore, we will have to use a towel or something to block the sun on the sides since the sun is on the driver's side for the majority of the time during our trips.That said, I couldn't find a back window shade with adequate reviews and am not a fan of the static cling side window shades in my car now that don't stay affixed to the window and make me always have to look twice before changing lanes (in a very busy traffic area) since I am not sure if what I see in my peripheral vision and in back side window is a vehicle distorted by a sun shade or a dark sun shade. I can't forsee this issue with my current shades being any better in the winter. Therefore, this was the perfect option for us so we can ditch the crappy static cling shades we have now. With a few small changes mentioned above, I think this could overtake the entire sunshade market. I am obviously not the only person who dislikes the current options of vehicle sunshade options.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "08 1, 2011", "summary": "Not covered on the sides from sun but still the best thing on the market"}

We were having an issue with a lot of brands of crib sheets shrinking up and becoming a hassle to get on, or my son being able to pull the corners up when he got bored. We have also been slowly switching my 2 year olds room from giraffe-themed stuff to a mix of giraffes and dinosaurs, same colors as this sheet set too. : ] Bought these, tried them on before washing them and they were actually a little big. They have now been washed and dried several times exactly as the directions on the tag say, and they fit perfect now. Another awesome tidbit is that the first night I put these on my son's bed, I took him over to the crib before our usual bedtime story, and pointed out his new colorful bed sheets. He smiled, giggled, and reached for the bed. Storytime was skipped that night. I could hear him on the baby monitor cooing and laughing for about 30 minutes before silence commenced. I'm pretty sure from his initial reaction he was having a ball studying his new and interesting bed sheets! : ] A great buy, great quality, thick and soft sheets that are well worth the slightly higher price.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "12 19, 2012", "summary": "Fits great, even made my son smile."}

I think I've finally found the ONE and I've had every type of bag: messenger style, back pack, duffle, big, small, the fisher price fast finders, a simple tote bag, and a $100.00 Skip Hop bag that broke after 1 week of use.At first glance, I didn't love the material (wipe clean/ water proof) of the bag but after thinking about all of the germy places diaper bags are placed its nice to be able to take a clorox wipe to it once in a while and not worry about ruining the material.  I also thought the bag was going to be too long and narrow to fit anything or I'd have to dig around too much to get what I needed but this hasn't been true.  It's amazing how much you can fit in here!  Also, unlike other bags even when full the bag isn't overly bulky or heavy.  All zippers can be zipped and unzipped with one hand...this is a must!  The bag comes with a good size changing pad which is nice because most of the freebee pads that come with diaper bags are way too small.  Its not cushioned at all though.  Instead I use the matching JJ cole mixed leaf diaper satchel which is nice, it has a built in \"pillow\" and saves me some room in the bag since I can store diapers and wipes right in the satchel itself.Pros-*Multiple carry options - shoulder, tote, or stroller straps.  The shoulder strap has a grip and thick padding and the stroller straps can stay on the stroller unlike the Skip Hop \"shuttle clips\" which are attached to the bag itself.*Cute leaf pattern is gender neutral.*You can find matching accessories (bottle cooler, paci pod, diaper satchel, diaper and wipes pod).*Just the right amount of structure: not too floppy, not too rigid, and little metal \"feet\" on the bottom.*POCKETS!!! 6 internal (2 are mesh) and 6 external ( 1 bottle, 2 zippered, 1 accessory pocket, and 2 thin pockets the size of the bag that are held shut by magnetic snaps)*Tote straps are the perfect length to wear comfortably and not fall off your shoulder, they also store out of the way if you aren't using themCons-*There is only 1 bottle pocket and it is not insulated.  Two insulated pockets would be better esp for mutiple children or younger babies.*There is no inside zipper pocket for personal mom stuff.*When the interior pockets are full it is a little tough to fit much in the interior section of the bag itself, but the pockets are roomy so if they are full you shouldn't need that much more unless you are overpacking or packing for 4 kids.I use this bag as a purse and a diaper bag, so a zippered pocket on the inside would be nice but its not a deal breaker.  I just use one of the inside mesh pockets for things like, mints, gum, pads, chap stick, advil, etc...  The other mesh pocket holds some baby tylenol, oragel, a teething toy, and some tissues.  I use the zipper pockets on the outside for my wallet, cell, keys, and camera.  One outside snap pocket holds a book for my son and my kindle fire nicely.  The other holds a skinny travel pack of wipes and a small diaper rag, or hat, or sometimes keys, or whatever else I might need quick.  The main pockets of the bag hold all the essentials: a toy or two, a can of spray sun block, two spare outfits, a nursing cover which doubles as a blanket, a wet bag, the diaper satchel, paci pod, snacks, food pouch, juice box, bibs, diaper rag, and a couple of extra diapers.  All of this with some room to spare.  I use a Thermos sippy cup in the non insulated bottle pocket, or I just keep a water bottle in there for me.  In the accessory pocket I keep a small size tube of hand lotion and a bottle of hand sanitizer.Since my son is 14 months I can't comment on how this would fare for a newborn.  I think bottle storage would be an issue but I don't see the extra outfits, diapers, and burp cloths newbs need as being an issue.  There seems to be room for the nursing and formula accessories moms to newborns need as well (nursing pads, dry formula containers).  Not sure about multiple children either but I hope this bag lasts that long and I can update this review when I have another one.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "08 14, 2013", "summary": "it's the one!!

She went everywhere with us. Then one day the baby just began rejecting her and still won't touch her. After teething for months but getting no teeth all I can figure is she got sick of Sophie. I was left scrambling to find another suitable teether 'cause just a couple days before the baby turned one she cut her first three teeth in two days!After reading the reviews here I figured these had to be worth a try in spite of how pricey I think they are for such a small item. I am so happy I did though because this two pack is perfect. One for the house and one for the diaper bag. We got an orange lamb and a red elephant, each having a slightly different shape and thus textures. The baby prefers the lamb's butt and the elephant's ear/head. After a couple of weeks I noticed that the seams of the mold in those areas does wear a bit easier and tiny bits of the rubber were coming off so I do recommend being really careful with these softer rubber teether since they do have the potential for that.The vanilla scent is pleasant but not strong and my baby seems not to notice it. Or perhaps she's just gotten used to it. Either way these are a great teether in my opinion/experience as the rubber is soft, the scent isn't nasty, the texture and colors seem to be pleasing and while small the handles are just right for a baby's hand to hold. These are a little pricier than some teethers but make up for it in durability and versatility.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "12 14, 2010", "summary": "Watch for small nicks at seams... otherwise excellent!"}
