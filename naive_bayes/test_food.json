Usually the box finds itself being used as the crust for a pie or cheesecake.  But these, since they were a special flavor I decided to eat (although they bake just as well).For eating, these made a really good breakfast.  I was surprised that you could actually taste the apple in these graham crackers.  Usually in apple cinnamon flavored products, you can taste the cinnamon but not the apple, so this was nice.  It was also visually appealing because you could see the little oats right on top of the graham cracker.  I didn't really taste them though, but I sure felt healthy eating it!  Another great aspect of these crackers were that they were made with whole grains.  I normally eat whole grains and am used to the flavor, but I didn't notice much difference in taste between these and regular non-whole grain crackers.  These graham crackers weren't really addicting though (which could be good or bad depending on the person) and they weren't the first thing I would choose to eat if headed for a snack.  They were good, but not something so excellent that I would look forward to them.Ingredients: Graham flour (whole grain wheat), Whole Grain Rolled Oats, Evaporated Cane Juice, Safflower Oil, Honey, Sugar, Brown Rice Syrup, Apple Juice Concentrate, Raisin Paste, Leavening, Sea Salt, Cinnamon, Vitamin E, and natural flavor.  This is surprisingly nice in a world with HFCS and other artificial flavors and preservatives seem to rule.On a different aspect, Back to Nature seems to be a good company to buy from.  They are a support of Nature Conservancy and the boxes for these crackers were made of 100% recycled paperboard.  I would probably use these graham crackers again, or check out some regularly flavored kind by the same company.Review by M.

It is a reddish colored, creamy sauce that does have a very good flavor and just a hint of heat.  It makes my food enjoyable to eat.

Alas, it was not to be.Here's my take on this cappucino drink:PROS:1.  Convenience -- With these cans at home or at the office, you can heat up a full cup of cappucino in a minute in the microwave. No dragging out the cappucino maker or running out to get a cappucino.2.  Foam -- After heating, you will see a small amount of foam on the top of the coffee.3.  Low-Cal -- Only 100 calories in this cappucino,and therein lies my problem.CONS:1.  Taste -- Even though I love cappucino, I don't have it often.  When I do give in to the urge, I want it rich with two packs of raw sugar, whole milk, and a generous dash of cinnamon on the foam.  Heavenly.  But this cappucino just doesn't measure up to my idea of what cappucino should be.2.  Off Flavor -- There's an odd taste of tin in my cup.  Maybe it's the cinnamon, maybe it's the can -- I can't say, but I can say that the flavor is tinged with an odd tinny taste.OVERALL:If you're not picky about cappucino, this could be your drink.

If you're gluten free and don't want to feel left out when everyone else is crunching on pretzels, then I guess these are for you, but I think it's important to be aware when you are removing something from your diet (like gluten) and end up consuming far more of something else because of that (like corn starch.)

Not a bad thing necessarily but just so you know.I got a seemingly giant, rectangular, pretty red tin with two trays filled with a lot of cookies (each tray has the same assortment).  There are two types of cookies that are predominantly white chocolate, with a third which is half-white and half-regular.  Then the rest are either dark or milk chocolate.  The cookies are what I would say is normal sized (i.e., for most people that would be two to four bites per cookie).  Inside the tin's lid is a chart describing each type and pointing out which ones have nuts, etc.These cookies seem to melt easily.  I took a chance on the end of the winter season in Florida, and they arrived sort of stuck together in their compartments, but generally I was able to break them apart.  Still I noticed that at room temperature they did get a little soft, such that they will easily leave chocolate on your fingers.  I just kept them in the refrigerator to get around that problem.I would say there are about 5-6 cookies of each type in its own compartment in the tray; so with two trays you are getting roughly a dozen of each type.  Some are much bigger than others, or thicker, so you get only 4 of that type.  But, it's a lot of cookies.I'm not really a tin collector, but I thought this really sturdy, pretty red tin was an added-value perk of this product.  It's a useful size for a lot of things and isn't covered with hokey illustrations like a lot of tins are.  Mine had a subtle textural patterning; unsure if they are all the same, as the photo on Amazon appears to show a tin that is shaped differently than the one I received.I would probably order these only occasionally, and during the cooler winter season, because they are so rich.

When testing the black cherry flavor, I had placed the can in the freezer for a short period, since I prefer drinks to be ice cold or hot; I didn't want lukewarm to get in the way of a positive response to the first sip.  As the drink warmed a bit, the sweetness overtook the carbonation, which is inevitable in a carbonated beverage, yet, due to the purity of the fruit base, the flavor remained true and welcome.When trying the kiwi flavor, I just had the drink chilled perfectly for me, no ice crystals.  I like the kiwi even better than the cherry!  The kiwi has more tang.  See below (or on the product description on the buying page) for the juice blends used.  I've noticed that most juices currently have apple and grape included, likely because those are cheaper to produce.The way the drink was promoted wasn't a lie!  It worked for me:1. \"100 % of what you want.  0% of what you don't want.\"2. \"Make The Switch to a great tasting, all natural beverage that's the perfect balance between JUICE and CARBONATION.\"3. The logo has \"THE\" placed upside-down and reversed, atop \"Switch,\" with a swirl designed around the words, the swirl imitating the symbol for reversing something.4. The ingredients read: \"100% juice (filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates, apple, grape, kiwi, acerola* [I added the asterisk; see below] and raspberry and strawberry juice concentrated), natural flavors, ascorbic acid (vitamin C)\"5. 100% juice carbonated.6. The can is smaller than the norm for soda pops, which I also liked, because when I used to drink sodas regularly, I usually opened a can and left half of it to get too warm (and fizzed out), so the remainder went down the drain (after I returned it to the fridge for a few days hoping I might drink it).  I drank the whole can of Black Cherry!I decided I liked the near slush state of a short stint in the freezer... leaving it too long, though, might cause too much separation of the fruit concentrate from the fizz water... and, of course, makes it undrinkable from the can until it melts enough to flow through the hole in the top.In the past, when I had begun wanting something more natural than most soda beverages (with phosphates, etc., added), I had used frozen orange juice concentrate added to Club Soda or Ginger ale.  It didn't take long to feel that the process was too much trouble (and it was more expensive than the cost of the Switch product).  Also, I like the types of fruits Switch is using.At first I was confused at the acerola* ingredient, not knowing what it was.  Since myKindle 2: Amazon's New Wireless Reading Device (Latest Generation)was at hand, as always, I looked up acerola in the onboard dictionary.  The word wasn't in there, so I pushed the curser to the right, on the arrow for more types of searches, and used my standby, Google, and found several listings of acerola.Briefly, I found that it's thought to have originated from the Yucatan, and is known as Barbados cherry or wild crape myrtle, a tropical fruit-bearing shrub.  Reading into the variety of praiseworthy qualities of that cherry, I was impressed!  It has 32 times the amount of vitamin C as Orange juice, and many other healthful assets.  If you're interested in details, feel free to go Google.I'm beginning to think that many of the flavors available from Switch will include equally intriguing tropical fruits.  (I was glad to see that other flavors also have acerola in them).Though the can is appealing and fine, this beverage is good enough to deserve a designer bottle to appeal to the gourmet crowd who want flavor without true health issues... don't get me started on the myriad of heavy promotions of pseudo health issues.  I have a book in progress to be published on KINDLE, which will debut with steam hissing out of Kindle's ears, at no extra charge!  (I'll add a comment to this review about why I had quit drinking soda pops, which will explain why I will be happily able to welcome Switch into my diet.)My thanks to THE SWITCH for providing a healthy, gourmet quality drink...

This is one:==========================================================Review of Harmful Gastrointestinal Effects of Carrageenan in Animal ExperimentsJoanne K. TobacmanCollege of Medicine, University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa, USAIn this article I review the association between exposure to carrageenan and the occurrence of colonic ulcerations and gastrointestinal neoplasms in animal models.Although the International Agency for Research on Cancer in 1982 identified sufficient evidence for the carcinogenicity of degraded carrageenan in animals to regard it as posing a carcinogenic risk to humans, carrageenan is still used widely as a thickener, stabilizer, and texturizer in a variety of processed foods prevalent in the Western diet.I reviewed experimental data pertaining to carrageenan's effects with particular attention to the occurrence of ulcerations and neoplasms in association with exposure to carrageenan. In addition, I reviewed from established sources mechanisms for production of degraded carrageenan from undegraded or native carrageenan and data with regard to carrageenan intake.Review of these data demonstrated that exposure to undegraded as well as to degraded carrageenan was associated with the occurrence of intestinal ulcerations and neoplasms. This association may be attributed to contamination of undegraded carrageenan by components of low molecular weight, spontaneous metabolism of undegraded carrageenan by acid hydrolysis under conditions of normal digestion, or the interactions with intestinal bacteria.Although in 1972, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration considered restricting dietary carrageenan to an average molecular weight > 100,000, this resolution did not prevail, and no subsequent regulation has restricted use. Because of the acknowledged carcinogenic properties of degraded carrageenan in animal models and the cancer-promoting effects of undegraded carrageenan in experimental models, the widespread use of carrageenan in the Western diet should be reconsidered.Environ Health Perspect 109:983-994 (2001).==========================================================I contacted the vendor to inquire of this, below is their answer:==============================================Discussion Thread---------------------------------------------------------------Response Via Email (Nancy Bruland) - 10/02/2013 04:55 PMDear Al,Thank you for contacting Organic Valley.For quite some time we've been actively seeking to reformulate our cream, chocolate milk, eggnog and soy milks in order to eliminate the need for carrageenan.

We're working hard so that the small number of other products in our line that use carrageenan won't be far behind.

I let it boil and bubble for a bit in the microwave, which is when the cooking really occurs. I often let it sit in the microwave for a few minutes after it stops, to set up. Years ago a ham radio guy asked me (over the air!) whether I knew how to make gourmet microwave hot cereal. I said no - wondering how you could make anything gourmet, especially cooked cereal, in the microwave - but that I didn't express out loud... so he explained to me the above method, with emphasis on heating the cold water before adding the cereal. And definitely not using hot tap water, as that has the O2 chased out of it, or some such. So I guess that must be it!I used to laboriously mix various cereal grains to achieve this kind of mix, but with this product it is all done for me. It's also good with raisins added.I'm delighted that Amazon is selling some of these healthy food items that are hard to find in parts of the country.

Most of the tea sold in American supermarkets is just... junk. Floor sweepings, as my Indian friends would say.

But Constant Comment has a special place in my heart, and I go on binges where it is pretty much all I drink. The aroma is lovely, and the combination of orange rind and cardamom makes for an interesting and flavorful cup of tea. CC is probably floor sweepings, too. But it tastes great and is very comforting. I do love these large boxes of 40 tea bags (4 bags per foil pouch) that Amazon sells, as it is convenient and long-lasting.

The boxes have the individual wells for the cups, so that they are securely held in place. If you are ordering from Crazy Cups, this is what you will get. Any other seller, you are taking your chances.As for the coffee variety, I see that people have had different experiences over time. I ordered mine about a month ago, and all 70 cups were unique. There were flavored coffees, some iced coffees, a couple of ciders, mochas, and other specialty variations. The roasts range from mild to super bold. I think I may have gotten only one or two decaf cups, which is a shame because I like to drink coffee at night, too, and decaf just makes more sense to me. Thankfully there are a wealth of reviews for every brand you can buy here on Amazon and I had no problem figuring out which decaf to get!One thing to consider with a variety sampler like this is the fact that you will get mild, medium, and dark roasts, in cups that vary in content amount, which in a standard Keurig means that your brewed cup will vary in intensity because you cannot adjust the amount of water it brews per cup. If you have a multi-brew machine like theBUNN MCU Single Cup Multi-Use Breweryou do have the option of varying the amount of water that brews, from 4 to 14 oz. so you can still control how mild or how strong the resulting cup is.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "07 11, 2013", "summary": "True Variety of Brands and Roasts"}
