I don't know anyone with the counter space to store mixing bowls out in the open.  It is so much easier to pull this bowl set out of whatever crevice they're stored in. I keep my bowls on a low shelf and I can pull the set out with one hand. That's convenient.Actually using the bowls was another pleasant surprise. The bowls have a slight flex and \"give\" when you hold them to your body  while mixing. Not a lot, but just enough to feel like the bowl is moulding itself to you. I know that last sentence sounds a bit silly. I felt silly writing it. But give these bowls a try.The cover is a waste of plastic. The bowls are made to have the colanders nest inside, but the cover doesn't fit with the large colander nested in the bowl.

I have a lot of Oxo stuff and love it all.I have to be honest though, I was kind of hoping this would replace my mandolin.I have the Oxo Mandolin and while I love it, it's a pain in the tukas to break it down and put it back together every time.This little mini slicer/grater works kind of like a mandolin in that you set up the blade in the bowl (it locks in really easily) and then use a gripper to slide your victim back and forth across it until you have what you want.It's shreds carrots really nicely, kinda like your house salads in a restaurant. Everything is very sharp and pretty effortless.It grates cheese like a standard grater but turned on it's side so it's easier and it has a little measuring bowl to catch it all which I also love. Everything breaks down and goes into the washer easily, it stores really nicely.It's a genius little kit and I definitely recommend it.So then my disappointments were based of some preconceptions from the pictures and experience with other Oxo products.It's not going to replace your mandolin first of all. It could to some degree if they make different inserts with some other thicknesses, but as it is right now you get super thin slices and that's it. You're not going to be slicing tomatoes, julienne fries or anything with it.I guess you could slice potatoes to fry up some chips but they will be really thin. I wanna say it's like 1/16th, I tried to make apple chips for my daughter with it and they came out paper thin. Would be great for cheese slices though.The cheese grater is just a standard grater. What blows me away about this is I have an Oxo grater that grates in both directions, it's brilliant, seriously. This thing would be perfect for the dual direction grater and instead it's just a standard grater. It really makes no sense. After using the Oxo grater for so long now this was kind of frustrating, especially since I'm already making the back and forth action with the gripper.But as far as complaints that's all I've got.I love this set, it's another great idea from Oxo, I'll probably ditch my current cheese grater for it, maybe... I really like that thing. But this set breaks down, cleans up and stores so much easier.It's not the epic kitchen tool I thought it would be when it came up for review and I'm seriously stumped at how they could leave out the obvious features found in their other cheese grater, but it is definitely worth having in the kitchen for quick prep work without a lot of fuss.One more blade with a 1/8 or 3/16 depth would've sealed the deal for me. That would've made this a must have item.I'm definitely keeping it and I've already used it quite a few times.Just wish it did a little more.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "04 15, 2014", "summary": "Sweet little set.

And the cherry on top was that there was only about 5 ounces remaining in the bottle. In full disclosure, I store all my bottles in my wine refrigerator after sealing.To avoid stoppers from staining and smelling, I would advise to hand-wash and air dry immediately after use. I have never washed the pump - just keep it and spare stoppers in a Ziploc bag.Highly Recommended!Pros:* Works as advertised* Simplicity in Design* Well-constructed* AffordableCons:* Will stain and smell if left unwashed", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "04 11, 2014", "summary": "Save Your Wine For Another Day!"}

It is thin, light-weight, and hangs on the wall when not in use. The suction is amazing. I have a dog and it vacuumed up all the hair and dirt off the floor. I charged it all night before using and the charge lasted through the entire room - 10 feet x 12 feet. This is the perfect vacuum for small spaces.I have tried many cordless vacs and they never have much suction - the Dyson is amazing and lives up to its promises.As an added bonus I am able to vacuum areas of my hardwood floors as well. This vacuum is well worth the price and the two year warranty is great!", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "07 17, 2012", "summary": "Lightweight - lots of suction power!"}

Second, I am also concerned that items like vegetable lasagna and cheesecake are listed when the nutritional composition of these, and many other foods included in the instruction book, can vary so widely. Third, illustrations are used to explain operation of the scale but even after a careful study I was confused and only managed how to figure out how to switch from metric measurement and weigh food items.I think it's a nice product and very useful for the simple weighing of food. The main issue is the attempt at an awkwardly translated booklet. It needed a better presentation to enhance the scale's potential. Perhaps clearer instructions and a more realistic approach regarding foods that vary nutritionally due to variation of preparation would much better support a fairly well-designed product.(P.S.

It got the carpets cleaner than the professional cleaners and using a long hose with a wand attachment is not a back-breaker like upright home machines. Water filtration is superior to dry vacuuming with its smelly air and bags -- even with HEPA bags. There are features I loved...BUT THERE ARE FEATURES ABOUT THIS MACHINE THAT ARE AWFUL.  I'm giving the Big Green \"Complete\" Home-Cleaning System 7700 three stars for \"incomplete.\" The hose/intake/filter selection assembly is really user unfriendly, to put it mildly. The manual is not helpful. Customer support is an oxymoron --or is just moronic?  Specific details below:Unit Assembly gets an \"F\" The assembly for the /hose door/hose connection/ filter selector is hard to use. Precious time should go into cleaning and not on trying to figure the darn thing out -- the manual is not at all helpful. The hose connection is also very difficult.  It requires a very strong hand to turn and the notch is hard to find. Same goes for the solution connector. If one only had to install this once, that would be fine, but the hose has to be removed and replaced every time you remove the collection tank, or when you change cleaning functions (e.g. dry vacuuming to wet cleaning). The quick-release door is useless because you still need to re-attach the hose each time you change the water in the collection tank.  The filter selection markings are inside the collection tank, which steams up so it can be difficult to see the settings insideCustomer service from the Philippines is an oxymoron (with emphasis on the last two syllables.)After taking all my contact information and the name and model of the a woman whose English I could not understand asked for the individual model number, which is under the machine.  I told her I could not access it because there was water in both the collection and solution tanks and I just had a simple question. She said answered to go ahead an turn the machine over.  I didn't follow her directions, obviously. Without the model number she would not help me -I never got an answer.Wet Carpet Cleaning gets an \"A\".  It has excellent extraction and cleans better than professional cleaning. Carpets dry quickly and the room smells very clean. However, when you turn off the machine make sure to turn the hose attachment up or dirty water pours out from the hose.Dry Carpet Cleaning a \"B\". The turbo carpet cleaner did a good job, but the attachment developed a very noisy rattle (like a screw that got loose.) I've only had this machine for a little over a week.Dry floor cleaning a \"B\".  Does the job.  The attachment has two levers -- w. brush or without--The levers are a good idea but be aware that because of the levers the attachment can't get under very low furniture. Water filtration is great, no odors dispersed into the air.Wet floor cleaning: \"A\" I used the micro cloth. This actually worked quite well and covered a large surface area quickly. Wide tile grout still needed a small toothbrush in spots, but overall this function is good.  Floors get really clean and the solution is fragrant. Attachments: \"C\" The turbo attachment developed a rattle the second time I used it. (Can't bear calling customer support again.) The attachments are very hard to release and take off.  This is not a new concept. Vacuum cleaner manufacturers figured this one out a long time ago, people.

When you are baking or broiling the counter will count down from the time you choose.Another poster commented on a different toaster oven how superfluous it is for a toaster oven to have a clock (as in time of day). This one does too. There's no need for it besides keeping the LEDs entertained while you're not using the oven.  However, the digits are very clear, bright, and easy to read. I find it rather amusing that I have four appliance clocks in my kitchen and I find myself using the toaster oven's the most!Toasting bread: The oven comes with six settings for non-frozen bread and six settings for frozen bread. I'll usually set the average analog toaster a little under the half-way mark and I had heard toaster ovens don't toast as well as regular toasters, so I chose the 't3' setting (middle) the first time around. The bread came out burnt. Then I tried 't2'. The bread came out slightly darker than I'd like. So now I'm always using 't1'. Unless you're eating a Flintstone's-size piece of bread, stay away from the higher settings! The overall toast result is very consistent though. Maybe it's the square heating elements.I haven't used the bake functionality. I'd imagine it to be much like an oven. I referred to the manual before using the broil functionality to cook breakfast links. They took a fraction of the recommendation for a similar meat.Downsides: I'd like to have more realistic toaster controls than not burnt vs. five levels of burnt. Also, the racks don't slide forward by themselves when you open the door. Instead, they are a very tight manual fit. Thus, you always find yourself using a spatula.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "07 21, 2008", "summary": "This Oven is Hot (Really Hot)!"}

For this use, it rates a full five stars.  If you intend to use it for baking, please read further.This Freshware 30-Cavity Silicone Chocolate, Candy and Peanut Butter-Cup Mold is easier to use than the molded plastic variety.  The chocolates pop out (once hardened) without any effort.  Because some reviewers complained about baked good sticking to the silicone surface, I thoroughly read the small users' manual that accompanies the product before using it.The manual states that, prior to its first use, the mold needs to be rinsed in hot water.  (I did that, allowing the mold to completely air dry.)  Then, it needs to be lightly coated with oil, butter, or shortening--only the first time--before using it. Cleaning the mold should not be done with \"harsh detergents\" and that contradicts the manual's  approval of placing the \"...bakeware in the dishwasher.\"  It also states, \"Do not use abrasive cleaners or scouring pads on your silicone bakeware.\"  Unless you run your dishwasher without detergent, that's just not possible.  If you have already purchased this mold and are having problems cleaning it, refer to the manual for further advice.Even the name of this product is a misnomer.  Nowhere in its title does it imply that it is for use in the oven as bakeware. The manual recommends adjusting recipes (for baked goods) that are low in fat or, high in sugar content to prevent sticking.  Of course, you won't know this until you try baking in the mold.  So, unless you want to do a trial run or, adapt recipes that may stick, I suggest using the mold for candy making.This is one of the molds I'm using to make a large variety of chocolates for a wedding.  Producing about half of the 1,500 confections has made me somewhat of an expert on the subject of candy molds.  I like this mold very much for chocolates.  The fluted lines are crisply detailed, giving my finished products a professional look.  Since I use it only for candy making, I find that rinsing it in very hot water is sufficient for cleaning.  The manufacturer's suggestion of soaking the mold in lemon juice and hot water to rid the mold of odors, prevented me from using it for the chocolates with creme de menthe flavoring.  I didn't want to risk a lingering odor that could be detected in the other varieties.  Since lemon juice would remove the 'slick' coating, I think it would be important to temper the mold once again (as if you were using it for the very first time).Maybe after the wedding I'll try baking in it.  For now, it's a five-stars winner for candy making.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "01 24, 2013", "summary": "Easy to Use, Quick Clean-Up"}

Even when it does hit furniture, Neato moves more slowly, so is less likely to shake fragile items onto the floor when it bumps into table legs.* Neato vacuums the floor in a more methodical row-by-row pattern (versus Roomba's method of diagonal turns when it bumps into something), so Neato is more likely to cover the whole area.* Neato didn't move our bath rugs around as much as Roomba.* Neato didn't move its charging base around (versus Roomba that gets stuck to it's charging base if it's not affixed to the wall and pulls the base across the floor).* Neato's dust bin is easier to remove (lifts out from the top, versus having to turn the vacuum upside down).  But you still need to flip it over periodically to clean hair from the silicone beater flaps.* Neato's charging LED can be shut off if desired (instead of serving as a night-light)Con's:* Neato uses a beater brush with silicone flaps instead of a brush.  Dirt seems to stick to the silicone flaps and can scratch up a soft flooring material such as travertine or marble tile (surfaces where you'd normally turn off the spinning brush if you were vacuuming manually)* Neato picks up dust just fine, but it leaves larger items behind (for example bits of leaves that Roomba will pick up).* Unlike Roomba, Neato does not have an edge brush, so it does not clean at all under cabinets or furniture that has an overhang, such as along the front of kitchen cabinets.  It also does not clean edges of the walls as well as Roomba, and that's where dust seems to collect the most.* In my experience, both robotic vacuums stop running before the whole floor is completed.* We didn't like how Neato's tractor wheels dug into rugs and carpet.* Neato does not come with virtual (optical beam) barriers; it does come with magnetic tape that it's not supposed to cross, but I can't imagine sticking that to the floor to keep it out of a particular room.* Because Neato's spinning laser sensor is around 4\" above the ground, Neato did not want to clean under a bed with a dust ruffle unless the ruffle was lifted up out of the way.* Both Neato and Roomba vacuums are noisy when operating, like a small regular vacuum.* Neato gets confused by a glossy baseboard finish, causing erratic movement and trouble mapping the room.  (Roomba was somewhat confused by this also, but perhaps not as much since Roomba doesn't even bother trying to map the area [as far as I can tell])I love the concept, but it didn't turn out to be as practical as I would have hoped. Hopefully some of the \"cons\" above will be resolved in future product generations. Also, it would be cool if the base had a feature where it sucked out the dust into a larger bin so the small bin didn't need to be emptied every day.", "overall": 3.0, "reviewTime": "02 28, 2012", "summary": "Concept is good, but room for improvement"}

Handmade Vintage...", "helpful": [1, 1], "unixReviewTime": 1395273600, "reviewText": "I have never owned a kitchen scale. Secretly I have wanted one, but never thought I would actually use it.  I also knew that with our current home (a 100 year old, country home with a tiny eat in kitchen and small (and already full with appliances) counter tops) we really couldn't and shouldn't place one on the counter for fear of losing remaining precious space.  I learned about the Ozeri company a few months ago when I was reviewing their body bathroom scale.  I was blown away by the style, durability of materials, and precision of that scale.  It was a beauty to place in our bathroom and I adore that scale.  It is super easy to read and looks super classy.  When I found out the company had a kitchen scale, I knew I wanted to review it and was so overjoyed when I got the opportunity.  I knew I wanted the kitchen scale to be white. Not only does it match our vintage pink, green and white kitchen, but I always am a fan of white electronic devices. Classy.The Ozeri Digital Kitchen Scale Touch II with Microban Antimicrobial Product Protection comes in black or white and can handle up to 11.2 pounds for weighing food in the kitchen.  It is slim in profile and about 1/2&#34; high. It reminds me of a small ipad or tablet.  It is very easy to store, and is a space saver.  Mine is white with a large blue backlit LCD screen that displays weight in pounds, kilograms, grams, and ounces.  It includes 2 Lithium batteries, which is great because don't we all hate it when we order something, get all excited to use it, then it arrives without batteries and you of course never have the size you need readily on hand?  Other neat features are the low battery and overload indicators.  This scale automatically turns off after 2 minutes of inactivity to preserve battery life.The Mictoban protection is a fantastic aspect of the scale as those who weigh any type of meat/fish would want to take extra care with preventing transfer of salmonella and ecoli, and other nasty germies. (make sure to obviously wipe with disinfectant wipes in between uses as well) The scale is permanently treated with Microban and works for the lifetime of the scale, to maintain surface cleanliness.  According to what I have read recently, bacteria can double every 20 minutes on an unprotected surface...frightening. The Microban is built into the scale, so it does not wipe off. The scale's smooth, sturdy, tempered glass surface is very easy to clean between uses. We usually disinfect everything with Clorox wipes, and this makes it very convenient.  It is nice that there aren't any crevices on the surface where juices or food remnants would hide.It has an automatic Tare button that quickly calculates the net weight of your ingredients by subtracting the container weight, (bowl, tray, plate, sippy cup, etc.) for the net ingredient weight. So you would weigh the container or bowl, scale remembers and sets that to zero, then you would put the food or liquid in the container, and weigh the food in the container without adding weight of container.  This is helpful for those who are on a diet and need to control portions or calories, as well as those who are baking/cooking.  My husband like to buy our hamburger meat / and steak in bulk and then separate it into small packs to freeze, so this is handy for him. Weighing food in recipes means no variations in measurements for accuracy.  Such as if you are putting flour or sugar in a measuring cup and it is tightly packed vs. being in the same measuring cup loosely put in.  The only issue I had when using the tare and on/off button was I would have preferred the on/off button be farther away from the tare button and perhaps a tad bigger.When I was testing this out, I realized the best way to keep things as accurate as possible is to keep the ingredients in the center for consistent reading.  At first I was putting the scale on my vintage red and white pin dot cotton place mats to look artsy for the photos, and then I realized that a few of the times it had the message &#8220;unSt&#8221;, which at first confused me.  I realized that the scale will detect if it is not on a stable surface and register unSt if the base is unstable.  This was similar to when I tested out the Ozeri body weight scale on my bathroom rug. I weighed considerably less and although I liked that previous weight better, I wanted accuracy so moved it to my bathroom tile and the scale was right on the dot with my accurate weight.  So remember to always use the kitchen scale on a completely flat surface.My most favorite use for this scale is the fact that I can use it to weigh letters and small packages.  I sell a lot of things in my etsy shop (mainly first class and priority in small packages) and this scale is super convenient to have downstairs and not have to go up the somewhat steep steps to weight something in the office.  I am in my third trimester of pregnancy and not a fan of frequent stair climbing. We have a cheapy plastic postage scale that I have had for years that is bulky and plugs into the wall. It is an ugly ole thing in dark blue and takes up space.  I am super happy to be able to use this shiny white, slim, classy and accurate kitchen scale for weighing packages.  The Ozeri scale actually came with a US postal first class rate guide---for sending out packages.  Aren't they clever and so very thoughtful? They already knew I would need it! There is also the owners manual and a super helpful food calorie guide.I really am loving this scale and think that it is made well. It appears to be something that will last a long time and get lots of use.  If you are interested in a kitchen scale or even just a nice postage scale, this may be the product for you.  The surface area of this scale is nice.  When comparing this slim, small profile kitchen scale to my bulkier old postal scale, this scale takes up less room, does not need to be plugged in, and yet has more surface area to weigh my packages while still being able to see the lcd display.I was sent this scale to review in exchange for my honest opinion.  I do not always review products with such positivity.  If I like something it will be known, but if I find issues, or problems with an item, or if I feel improvements need to be made, I will mention them. I feel that reviews of products should always be truthful and sincere, as it helps potentially interested buyers of a product learn what to expect and to see it it is a good fit for them before purchase.  Reviews also help the actual product and company to improve when needed. If you found this review interesting or helpful, please rate it as such, and or comment.

That does not affect its performance at all.  It passed with a rainbow of flying colors.This board does not slip or slide whether the surface is wet or dry. The tomatoes did not stain it. The jalapenos did not leave an odor. I used it side by side with my other favorite cutting board, a polypropylene one with grips that has been a favorite of mine. This one stood up to that test too.

It really does a great job for stir fry and it's a great value for the money.I like that this wok is not too heavy which is helpful when you have a lot of food in it that naturally makes what you're having to hold a lot heavier.  The lid is even lighter and there's not much substance to it, but it does its job perfectly.  I even use the lid on other things that I'm cooking at the same time since it's so big it fits over all my other pots and pans.One tip when you're attaching all the handles: there was no instruction reminding me what the finished product looked like so I couldn't figure out where the wood handle for the lid went until I had to use the lid about 2 dinners later...I realized I had no way to pick up the hot lid and I finally figured out what to do with the leftover wood nub sitting in my drawer. LOL!The one thing I still haven't figured out is how to properly season this thing.  The Q&As; and reviews would have you believe that watching a simple video will teach you the trick, but for me it has not.  I've taken extra great care in following &#34;seasoning&#34; instructions, but to no avail.  Instead I've just been developing gunk at the bottom of the wok and the pan is not turning black like I thought it would.  Maybe that only applies to seasoning cast iron and not steel.  I don't know, but if you're not worried about the seasoning, you'll be pleased with this wok.  It holds a TON of food.  I've put in 2-3 lbs of chicken, head of broccoli, carrots, 4 squash/zucchini, 8 oz mushrooms and then some and have room for everything to cook in this wok.

I know what goes into brewing good coffee, know the difference in quality between drip and a French Press, own a burr grinder, etc. My last machine was a DeLonghi super-automatic espresso maker that I used for Americanos, but it's currently in need of maintenance so I picked this up as an inexpensive and convenient interim option. I really wasn't expecting much, but I've been pleasantly surprised.The elephant in the room: first time I tried grounds in it, it barfed them all over the counter. What a bummer. But then I found the second basket insert that they now include in the revised version. Keep in mind most of the bad reviews on here were before February when they started including this. With the basket insert I've had no problems with overflow or grounds in the cup.The coffee quality is good, but not great at 2 Tbsp / 10 oz of water, medium grind, which is what Hamilton Beach recommends as the max. Unfortunately, it comes out a little weak that way, so I wasn't wholly happy with the results.I've played around with both grind and amount, and have found that the maker works best with 3 Tbsp / 10 oz, which is closer to the classic brewing recommendation of 2 Tbsp / 6 oz. You do need to mind the grind and keep it squarely medium, as this nearly tops up the grounds insert; if you grind too finely, water will overflow. At this strength, the coffee has a bit of body to it, and is quite drinkable.I also tried a finer grind at the 2 Tbsp recommended max, but that just made it drip slower without actually extracting much more flavor. That's counter-intuitive to me, but there's no question that the results were inferior to 3 Tbsp/medium grind. So, using more coffee seems like the way to go.It is worth noting that the machine has a shower-head for evenly delivering water into the grounds, rather than just a straight drip into the basket. That actually surprised me, as cheap machines sometimes do not have this. The FlexBrew does a pretty good job saturating the whole grounds basket, and I was never concerned that it only extracted through the middle.As a K-Cup machine, it's adequate. It's quite a bit slower than a genuine Keurig, without the flavor being noticeably better. It's also kind of a pain to clean out the residue of some of the more viscous drinks, like cocoa or chai, and having to completely swap out the grounds basket for the K-Cup receiver is a little more painful than using a My K-Cup style insert like most other machines. However, the larger grounds basket does give you more flexibility on how much coffee you use. Overall, I'd say this is a better grounds-based maker than K-Cup maker, now that they've fixed the overflow issue.A minor problem is splashing. The cup platform has two positions: completely down and way up high. Up high, it won't fit anything bigger than a standard mug, but does OK getting water in the cup with some minor splatter onto the machine. But if you use any sort of tall or travel mug, you'll need to use the bottom position. There, the water falls far enough to splatter on the counter around the machine. I put a stack of rubber coasters on the cup platform to raise my mug up and that largely fixed the problem, but it's a bit of a workaround. It'd be nice if the platform were more adjustable.The biggest dig is capacity: water maxes out around 10 oz, though you might be able to push it -slightly- higher, which means 8-9 oz after absorption and steaming off. I ended up buying a 10 oz mini travel mug for it, but it would be nice to be able to fill a more typical 14-16 oz mug. But no surprises there: it's a single-cup maker, and it means it. Don't buy it expecting anything else.Now that I have strength dialed in, I'd call it 4.5 stars as a single-serve grounds-based coffee maker and 3.5 stars as a Keurig machine. So, that's four stars average and a positive recommendation if all you want is a cup at a time. I'm happy with this machine.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "09 10, 2013", "summary": "Good coffee, versatile options"}

The Pro is great but you pay for the large capacity by its being less useful for very small batches of things. Enter the 3-qt Combi Whip combination - half the size, just right and seemingly engineered to make up the gap. I got it to make quick work of beating egg whites and cream.Unfortunately, it doesn't work. Both the bowl and the whip are well made, but they don't fit together - the beater doesn't reach the bottom of the bowl. This specially sized beater was made specifically to fit this smaller, more shallow bowl, but it's been machined a tad too short. The result is that your cream or egg whites will sit in the bottom of the bowl and not whip, no matter what. They're just not getting enough contact.I'm not the only one posting this problem, and another commenter here is replying to other complaints with directions on how to adjust the beater clearance at the back of the bowl arm. Well, no; adjusting the beater clearance is not a reasonable solution. If your clearance is just right for the large bowl, you don't want to mess with it just to whip a bowl egg whites and then have to adjust it right back to continue using the large bowl. Clearance, once precisely adjusted, should be left alone. If an extra attachment requires 2 instances of beater clearance adjustment each time just to use it, there is a problem.Too bad, because it's a great idea. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because it might work ok for thicker doughs, even if it can't do whipping. Since some folks here are happy with it, I'm guessing they're using it for cookie doughs and cake batters, and that's great. (You can't knead bread dough with this item.)

I also use them for making lemon and lime pies.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "05 16, 2009", "summary": "BLACK &DECKER CITRUSMATE PLUS CITRUS JUICER"}
