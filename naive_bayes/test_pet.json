My dog has severe allergies, and he has to be bathed in zymox, almost once every two weeks. Already gone through the diet changes, and stuff. I recently noticed that both pets were scratching more frequent, and losing hair. So I went on the hunt. Reading the reviews, I began to think possibly there skin was dry, because they both are indoor pets; with the exception of my dog going out to be excused several times a day. And now it is winter, and the central heat is a dry circulating heat.The first bath participant was my short haired petite cat. It usually takes about 10 or more minutes to bathe her thoroughly anyhow. Which makes the manu- directions of letting the product stay on, at least 10 minutes, worked out fine. I usually bathe at night; to give her skin time to recover the rest of the night; then the effects of the product will be made known immediately, when she wakes up the next day. So the next morning, no crazy scratching, nor pulling her hair. This stuff worked so well, I bathed my dog the next night. Using the same technique; letting the shampoo stay on for 10 minutes. This was the only shampoo that has given both my precious pets relief.I did notice that my dog started scratching again, a few days later. So I decided to reapply the water, and Epi shampoo on a cloth, but only on his hot spots. I did this while he was lying on the bed. I let this solution, soak in approx 30 minutes, while he ran, and played, inside the house. Then rinsed him off in the bathtub. That application really did the job. He is so happy, and jolly not having to stop playing, just to scratch. He used to wake up with a violent itch, and I knew it was not from fleas, nor bacterial infection, because the Zymox would take care of that. We all are so pleased with this product.Recently tried Palma castor oil on their skin as well. It works great for dry skinThanks to all reviewers who do take the time to share honest testimonials of how a product has worked for them, or for their wonderful pets.

I was hopeful since it is labelled low glycemic carbs, but I guess  there are just too many for my special kitty.  It's good to remember that although they sound like healthy ingredients, and for us humans they are, cats dont need grains like oatmeal or vegetables in their diet, and they are usually added to keep the price down, not keep the cat at it's best.  That being said, this food seems better than a lot of others on the market today, and like I said...they will eat it.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "04 23, 2014", "summary": "Nutience Natural Healthy Adult Cat Food"}

Great for putting in toys for treats as well! Bag is re-seal able!Been using this for a week now. Mixing 1/4 cup into my puppy's current food. She will usually eat half of her food then come up to me and \"thank me\" as if she was seeing me after being gone for a few hours. She then runs back and continues eating her food. Since mixing this, she will pick out these food first, and then leave her old food in her dish. When she thanks me she isn't as happy returning to eat her old food to finish off her meal.Update after :Take 2 weeks or longer in transitioning of your food!!!!!! I did only 10 days, and it wasn't enough.Well with the amount of food I had left I was only able to mix her food for 10 days. That IS NOT ENOUGH TIME to let her stomach adjust!!!!!!!!!! I watched her for the first week and she had a extremely soft stool! So much so, that I started to watch her water intake and if she changed in her speed in eating as if she knew it would upset her stomach but she remained a happy playful puppy. I also regulated her treats. It took about 10 days for her stool to start having any shape to it, and about 2-3 weeks after the full change over of the food her stools became solid and normal. I second the less bowel movements that everyone else has said, so for those of you who have to scoop, this would be beneficial to you. I have 2 acres, and mine insists on running 20 yards into the woods, so that was something I was glad I didn't have to train her to do. She goes in the morning and in the evening, and her stool quantity is half what it was with her Purina. She was doing fine on that, but figured I'd try something better. If you pay just a little bit more for this food, and she eats it over a longer period of time it all equals out in the end. I think I feed her less than the chart says, but I know she is full  when she comes in from going out an hour after she eats and hides her treat somewhere in the house (on top of her bed, in the corner of a step going up to the bedroom, and her favorite spot is here on the couch behind me skillfully digging and burying it behind me). I adjusted her meal size because it seemed the very little last bit she was not wanting to eat, and would walk away and come thank me for her food more and more. Since I've cut back on the food, she will come and thank me at least once while she eats but no more than that. She is gaining weight, and not chunky either. I don't know if it was a warm spell that we had, mid 30's-40's for 2 weeks in Dec, or the change over from food, or maybe shedding from puppy coat to normal hair but she did have some major shedding going on for a week or so. No globs coming out and when I used a brush on her not much hair now. I do not brush her daily anymore, the brush is the vacuum's little cousin I guess. Her coat is nice and silky to the touch.Also, I live in Alaska, and use the wood stove as my primary heat. I usually put 2-3 gal of water in the humidifier each day. With the Purina, she was scratching quite a bit, so much that I started adding a teaspoon of olive oil in with each meal. That helped her with that and she itched less, but never stopped. I think I may notice her scratch 2-3 times a day and it doesn't seem to be as focused and intense as it was before. It could be that she is just getting use to it up here as well, but there is a lot to be said for a healthy diet in humans. It is just the same for our pets.I have been trying to keep a 0700 and 1700 feeding time. I don't have her sitting at my feet a hour in advance doing her I'm hungry dance. There are times where I am working on something on the house and it will be almost 1900, and she is still just hanging out with me as normal not begging for anything. So I would think that would mean that she is content from the previous feeding, and that I have her food amount adjust pretty close to what it should be.One down fall of the small kibbles... when put in a feeding toy that they have to roll around to get food... the food comes out and goes under doors, edges of furniture. If your pet is aggressive, this could lead to holes pawed in carpet etc, I just have to sit and listen to non stop constant barking all over one morsel that has went under the laundry room door. She still has half a toy full of food, but she will not let even one get away.Second edit:I don't know if I my dog has started to have allergies or not. I have become fed up with her shedding more than a heeler should. I have switched to taste of the wild, bison, and well we are working through things and are getting her tested for other allergies. I will say this. Put a bowl of TOTW down and a bowl of wellness, the bowl of wellness will be left alone. The prices are about the same, but overall I think they are both better than cheap brand dog foods, but mine seems to have changed. I have since got a second red heeler female pup, and she finished off the half bag of what I had left with no issues what so ever, but she sure was interested in the smells coming from the other food bowl.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "12 21, 2012", "summary": "Great food"}

However it's a thicker piece of plastic that can protect against pet claw scratches. The roll contains a 15 feet of the film and it can be cut to any length you want. It's also 3 inches wide but you can cut it into a thinner strips if needed. It's very easy to apply. First you thoroughly clean the area that you plan on covering with the film. Then pull a section off the roll and cut it to size with a box cutter or a pair of scissors. Then carefully line it up and push it smoothly into place. You will want to smooth out and remove and air bubbles for best results. It will provide a durable and long lasting barrier to protect against cat or dog scratches. It works very well but I would highly suggest not applying it to painted wood. When we have visitors over we will typically lock our dogs in our bedroom because they bark non-stop and annoy our guests. They like to claw at the bedroom door when they want out and they have scratched a section of the paint off. I installed a couple strips of this protection film to the area which should do a good job of preventing additional damage. However I noticed if I would pull the film back up after applying it that much of the paint comes up with it. As a result when I eventually remove the film I will have to repaint the door.

We use them in the Booda Dome Cleanstep Cat Box (which I also really like), and I love that this litter doesn't turn into cement in the corners and bottom of the box like every other litter I've tried. I've used clay, wheat, corn, walnuts, and recycled paper, and this is the best in my opinion.Like others have said, Feline Pine Original comes in pellets that dissolve and turn into sawdust when they get wet. You then scoop out the sawdust and any poop, leaving the whole pellets in the box. It took a little time to come up with a system for using this litter in a regular litter box (as opposed to a sifting litter-box), but it's easy now. I have an extra plastic tub with a lid (that I saved from the TidyCats litter that I tried to use a long time ago), and that's where I keep a sifting litter scoop and a regular solid scoop (the solid scoop that I use is the Pureness 1-Cup Food Scoop that Amazon sells for less than a dollar, and it works just fine). When I'm cleaning the litter-box, I remove the tools from the TidyCat container and use them to move the solid waste from the litter-box into the TidyCats waste container. Then, I remove the sawdust from the box. I do this by pushing all the litter to one side of the litter-box and taking large scoops of the litter and &#34;sifting&#34; the sawdust into the TidyCats waste container. I then put the clean pellets back into one side of the litter-box and continue until I've sifted through all of it and am left with only clean pellets. Then, I dispose of everything in the TidyCats waste container, and put the scoops back in it for storage. I post this is an extremely long description of how I clean a litter-box, only because I was really tempted to buy a sifting litter-box just to use the Feline Pine. Then, I came up with this method, which is easy and allows me to keep using the Booda Dome Cleanstep Cat Box, which I really love.I like Feline Pine Original because it *doesn't* clump and turn into a sticky mess, and I feel like the cat box overall is cleaner because it doesn't have remnants cemented to the inside. The waste sawdust cleans up very easily. I also like that it controls urine odor better than any other cat litter I've used and it's unscented. Because it's unscented, it doesn't mask poop odor, so if you're right on top of the litter box, you'll smell a fresh poop for a few minutes, but the sawdust that forms when the pellets get wet helps to cover up the poop and dry it out so that it doesn't continue to stink.Before switching to Feline Pine, I was using the Blue Buffalo Naturally Fresh made from walnuts, and for odor control that would still be my second choice. However, the Feline Pine is still much cleaner and it is totally dust-free.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "08 17, 2013", "summary": "Surprisingly Good!"}

Prior to owning these toys, my golden retriever was the bane to all things stuffed. Anything I gave her, she immediately went to work at destroying it and turning it inside out. Since we have had these toys, she is much gentler with her other stuffed toys. Now that we have three dogs, our youngest, a German Shepherd puppy, is also thoroughly enjoying these toys.

While any food is better than no food, cat food which contains a high percentage of grains is pretty much useless to the cat consuming it. Cats are not herbivores or omnivores. They are carnivores.If you read the ingredients on this product and the other Feline Greenies dental treats flavors, you will see chicken meal, ground rice, ground wheat and corn gluten meal (likely from genetically modified corn), as the first four ingredients. Yes, the chicken meal is the first ingredient, but the fact that the next three are grains (or derivatives thereof) means a large percentage of the food is something your cat does NOT utilize very well.There are many articles from reputable sources that discuss the same things I have already mentioned. Here is an excerpt from one such article from [...] \"Cats are obligate (strict) carnivores and are very different from dogs in their nutritional needs. What does it mean to be an `obligate carnivore'? It means that your cat was built by Mother Nature to get her nutritional needs met by the consumption of a large amount of animal-based proteins (meat/organs) and derives much less nutritional support from plant-based proteins (grains/vegetables).

One cat is like a live wire and really needs to calm down. However, my other three are very calm (almost lethargic) with one of the three being geriatric.I selected this product for my one hyper cat.  I tried for several days to give them to him but he won't even eat half of one of the soft chews.  The first time I presented it to him he was very excited by the smell.  He looked like he was very interested in eating this as he quickly came down off his ceiling perch. However, I had no luck. I even tried putting it in his food and he ate around it.Because of all the warnings on the package, I was hesitant to try it on my other cats.  However, I decided to try it on them one time.  The others were also very enticed by the smell but only my 16 pound cat would eat one. The others walked away after smelling the soft chew. The one cat that ate it had absolutely no reaction at all and it's now been over one day. He also did not get any calmer that  he already is.As per the package,  the active ingredients of each chew are Thiamine (Vitamin B1) 31.25 mg, L-Theanine (Suntheanine brand) 10.56 mg, and Colostrum Calming Complex 5.28 mg.The ingredients are brewers yeast, calcium sulfate, canola oil, chicken liver flavor, citric acid, glycerin, maltodextrin, mixed tocopherols, propionic acid, rosemary extract, silicon dioxide, sodium alginate, soy lecithin, and vegetable oil.These are the cautions and warnings on the package:-  Safe use in pregnant animals or animals intended for breeding has not been proven.- If an animal's condition worsens or does not improve, stop product administration and consult your veterinarian.- For animal use only. (See contradictory statement below.)- Keep out of the reach of children and animals. Your pet may consider this a treat. In case of accidental overdose, contact a health professional immediately. (What this means to me is that your pet should not consider this a treat.)- For use in cats only.DIRECTIONS FOR USE: Up to 15 lbs. give one chew daily.  During times of increased stress, it is safe to double or triple this amount as needed.Based on the lack of interest by three of my four cats and the warnings above (taken from the package), I would not personally buy this product. I will mix it in with the used cat litter so that no other animal cat get to these. I have a friend who runs a shelter. Normally I would ask her to try products like this when my cats don't take to them; however, I just don't feel comfortable doing that with these chews.  If you have a hyper cat and you are considering this product because everything else has failed, then I guess it's worth a try.  Nevertheless, my recommendation would be to talk to your vet to see what he or she thinks of this soft chew for your particular pet before buying.", "overall": 2.0, "reviewTime": "06 23, 2014", "summary": "The warnings on this product make me nervous and the cat that needs this won't eat them"}

I've had mixed luck with Kong toys -- some of them, like the original chew toys and the SafeStix, are awesome and hold up well even when given to strong chewers, but this one is in pieces after less than a month.My dog is a 1-year-old Rottweiler who weighs a bit over 80 pounds.  She is one of the most destructive dogs I've ever had when it comes to toys.  She LOVES squeaky toys so, with some trepidation, I bought her this one.  For the first 2-3 weeks, this ring was actually all right.  I'd toss it, she'd retrieve it, and the squeaking kept her interest.And then it started coming apart.  This toy is joined in two places, directly across from each other.  On one side, a squeaker is concealed where the toy is joined.  At first, it started coming apart on the side where the squeaker is and I could push the squeaker back in.  But then, one day, I found that the squeaker had just disappeared.  It must've fallen out when my dog was running around the living room.  It hasn't turned up.  For all I know, my dog swallowed it!  (I'm not too concerned as she has \"passed\" some rather large objects in the past and she is not showing any signs of a blockage.)At any rate, shortly after the squeaker disappeared, the ring separated into two halves -- like big, blue pieces of elbow macaroni.  My dog still loves these two parts of the toy, and she hasn't managed to chew any pieces off of them yet, so I won't give this toy 1 star, but it lasted such a short time that it's not deserving of any more than two.  It's a pity; I had such high hopes for it.As always, supervise your dog with any new toy.  Due to the easy destruction of this one, don't leave your dog alone with it.", "overall": 2.0, "reviewTime": "12 4, 2013", "summary": "falls apart too easily"}
