Nobles", "helpful": [4, 8], "unixReviewTime": 1352851200, "reviewText": "It seems more and more manufacturers are offering so-called tool kits that are designed for small places such as kitchen drawers and glove boxes of automobiles. Most of them are cheaply made, overpriced, and really not worth the buyers time or money. I place this \"tool\" in that catagory for a number of reasons.For instance, the tool is heavy, weighing in at almost 1 1/4 pounds. It is also a bit bulky and overall definately not something you would drop or throw into a drawer, etc.While there are a total of 7 bits included there is only storage for 6 which means one is always one remaining in the socket. In addition, the holder for the 6 bits has a plastic cover that seems to be of questionable strength and will, I suspect, either break or expand over time and that will be a real problem.The flexible extension for the bit socket (screwdriver) does not have any type of attachment to the main tool and thus helps defeat the purpose of an all-in-one tool. I suspect this potentially handy part will have a tendency to get lost over time.As for the knife attachment I was less than impressed. You need to remove a cover on the tool and then extend the blade to use this one. After doing that you are presented with a cheap looking blade that will be OK if doing easy type work but will not be of much use under average to above average use.I think the idea behind this tool, as with many of the others, is good. However, it seems the manufacturers cannot bring together quality with size (smaller) and end us, as in this case, with a so-called tool that is costly and not well made. It will work, for awhile, for small, light duty jobs but even then I would not expect a long life for this one.", "overall": 3.0, "reviewTime": "11 14, 2012", "summary": "Unremarkable"}

It cuts sheet metal well, too, if you clamp the sheet down on plywood first. I've used the saw to do demolition work, like cutting out plumbing and furnace vent openings in wall sill plates, and cutting access holes into a shingled roof. It's great for cutting PVC and copper pipe, too. This little powerhouse will cut anything with the proper blade.

Those days are apparently gone. This utility knife is a basic run-of-the-mill utility knife. It is neither exceptional nor does it have major faults. It is just an average and somewhat ugly and clumsy utility knife. There is a button located near the front of the knife that can be pushed to close and open the knife blade holder. There is another button on the front of the blade holder that can be pushed to replace the blade. Changing the blade with this Snap-on is a two hand operation and easier to do then with, for aeample, the Stanley utility knife. You can hold this Snap-On knife in one hand and also use that same hand to push the release button while using the other hand to change the blade. With the Stanley you hold the knife in one hand, pull up the latch with your second hand and then you are required to use your third hand to change the blade. The Stanley has a better appearance but probably few utility knife users consider appearance a major factor when making a knife purchase.Although this knife is utile I would not have purchased it if I had known it was made in China or Taiwan.

Goodness knows how many times we all have reached into tight places to drive screws manually with ratchets or short screwdrivers. Not fun, is it? The Bosch PS10-2 gets into those tight areas for tasks like attaching drawer slides. Plus, it is reasonably small and light, so you will grab it for a lot of normal drilling and screw-driving tasks. The angle-head feature works perfectly and while 0 and 90 degree angles are the most used, once in a while another angle is useful.This Bosch uses what they call Clic-Change bits. These are 1/4 inch hex shanks with indentations on them (note that some bits have very small indentations for use in other devices. The ones for use in the Bosch are the bigger ones). They are available in every brand and every manufacturer makes drill/drivers that use these bits. This is not a Bosch exclusive. You pull the collar out, drop the bit in, and it is a quick and secure connection. Much nicer than wrestling with chucks.This is why they call these devices \"drivers\" instead of \"drills\". Twist drill bits can't be bigger than the hex shank, so they are limited in size and that makes it less flexible than a dedicated drill. Also, drills spin at high speed, while drivers are designed to operate at lower rpms. Bosch feels the primary use will therefore be to drive screws, and as a nut-driver.You can get spade bits because they have build-in hex shanks. Of course, a 10.8-Volt driver isn't meant to drill huge holes through studs all day, but it does have enough power to actually do that.You will still need to have a conventional drill with a twist chuck to use all the bits you have now and will need for many tasks.The slow-start feature would seem to be more useful on big powerful tools like routers, but you get used to it and can use a light touch when needed. The \"clutch\" isn't a conventional mechanical one and it takes a little getting used to, but it works.The angle feature is secure, the motor is smooth and powerful and everything seems well built. It is far from tiny, though, surprisingly big. It is not at all like those little electric screwdrivers. This is a full-sized, powerful drill/driver.What would make it better? It would be perfect if it had a a selectable impacting action.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "12 23, 2008", "summary": "Another angle"}

It's hard...", "helpful": [13, 15], "unixReviewTime": 1348963200, "reviewText": ". . . because when you think pleasing domestic atmosphere enhancement in the form of simulated flame, you think Energizer.  That is, think made in China for Energizer Holdings, Inc.The packaging shows the product well, and the packaging color scheme complements the candle.  I found the package somewhat hard to get into, that is, to find the little dab of perfectly transparent tape to get the thing open.  At least it didn't take hydraulic shears to cut through eighteen inches of industrial clear plastic.  Colored tape, a colored tab or even a tear-away zipper tab would be a great improvement for consumers to breach the package and reach the precious digital candle inside.The candle comes in at 3\" in diameter, and 6\" high.Note that it takes 4 AA batteries, which are not included.  The FCC compliance notice informs that this Class B digital device could interfere with some domestic radio communications, but I suffered no such problems.The package claims \"realistic flicker,\" and I concur.  It totally fooled both the wife and the kids.  I discerned no heat whatsoever from this product.  The LED bulb is set well below the lip of the candle, so its lighting effect is primarily through diffusion through the wall of the candle.  In a completely dark room this product provides minimal additional light (and a nice orangey circle on the ceiling).Note that this is for indoor use only.  This would not be good for an outdoor altar or cemetery vigil.The product's scent is \"honey vanilla,\" but I'm not quite sure what it is.  Of course, the scent does not fill the room as a real candle would, but the scent diffused in a small room relatively quickly, within about two hours.  It's a subtle scent, not unpleasant, but distinctly synthetic/industrial, a manufactured scent rather than something truly natural.  There does not seem to be any increase in the candle's scent if it is turned on or off.The product comes with a multi-folded user manual in English, French and Spanish.  As small user pamphlets go, this one at least has text that is large enough to be read by a human.  There are even a couple of diagrams, one for the installation of the batteries and the other to explain the two switches on the bottom for the on/off/timer and 4-, 6- and 8-hour settings.I tried all three timer settings, and all were accurate, as far as I could tell (no, I didn't time them out).  The candle knows when to turn itself on as well.  It's got an automatic timer setting which turns the candle on at the same time each day, and delays for your four, six or eight hours.  That's a cool feature.The instructions do specify that it is made from real wax; I read this as an implied warning that it could stain certain surfaces, such as fine wood.  I placed a folded sheet of white paper under it, and after a full week detected no trace of any kind of oil, wax, or any other kind of residue/seepage.Bottom line: If you're going to go with candles, there's nothing like real flame, real action, powerful scent, the real thing.  But if you've got pets, kids, or a domestic situation that doesn't lend itself to the real thing, this is a really good substitute, and totally safe.  The scent could be better, but other than that this is a good simulation of the real thing.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "09 30, 2012", "summary": "Wonderful Electro-Warmth"}

My hand wasn't up to that much squeezing.  I had several inexpensive Campbell Hausfield pneumatic nailers that worked well, so I took the chance on this caulker.  My primarily criteria was price because i didn't intend to use this much beyond this project.  I was surprised to find out that the product was far more versatile than I imagined.Most of the reviewers seem to be spot on regarding this caulker.  The unit is direct-air driven, so it is very sensitive to air pressure so you will need to regulate this for different products and at different pressures and temperatures.  From my experience (and for my applications), optimal flow through a 1/4\" nozzle opening for various products are:  PL construction adhesive - 45psi; 3M fireblock - 15psi; concrete patch -  50psi; 3M paintable silicone - 40psi. (all @ approximately 80degrees F).  In most cases i sought maximum flow rate with control a secondary concern.  If I wanted more precise application with maximum control, I'd back off the pressure considerably - maybe as much as 50%.  At this point I've run several hundred tubes ov various stuff through this gun without a problem.This is a very simple design - direct air flow into tube chamber.  As such there's not much to break if you keep the airlines clean.  For what I needed, it worked great.  I do not use this in caulking applications where tethering would be a problem - e.g., caulking windows while on a ladder, but for applying lots of product quickly, it works well.  One feature that I didn't appreciate until i used it was the convenience of tube replacement.  the segmented barrel screws off and on quickly.  this is essential in a production environment when dealing with quick set-up times (like using construction adhesive to sister joists, etc.)I have had no problem with the trigger as some have mentioned.  I've used this for an hour at a time with no ill effect.  I'll admit that the trigger suffers from poor ergonomics, but given the price i doubt they put a lot of funded research into this product.  It does not come with a pneumatic connector, which is fine for me as I only use Milton A-series quick-release connectors on my pneumatic tools, so different connectors are just wasted on me and end up in a coffee can under a workbench.The biggest concern that I had was that something at this low price would actually work as advertised.  I've found that this product has worked great under continuous use for hours at end with no problem as long as one stays on top of the pressure/temp curve.  I should mention that a balance needs to be established between flow rate and runout after trigger release.  The more viscous products will have greater flow resistance, so if you increase the pressure for optimal flow the residual pressure in the tube after trigger release will produce runout.  This is unavoidable for any caulk gun that doesn't have a trigger release/pressure release system built in, and is not a particular weakness with this product.Entirely satisfied.

After trying this one, my mind has been changed.  Setting this up to scan several fingers was quick and easy, the hardest part was finding the button to push behind the battery compartment.  There is also a button combination sequence that can be used if you dont want to use the fingerprint scan or find a need to tell someone how to open it for you instead of opening it yourself.  Of course, there is also a key as the final backup, in case the battery dies or you want an 'override' access to the safe.The safe itself is fairly small, but just the right size for a 'normal' handgun.  This fits my full size 1911 pistol in a paddle holster, with 2 extra magazines, but it takes a bit of thought to get it pointed correctly to fit.  You wont fit a Dirty Harry style .44 Mag or a S&W; 500 with 10&#34; barrel in this, but it will fit what most people have or use.The fingerprint scan is quick and very fast, opening the lid quickly and silently.  This aspect is MUCH nicer than I thought it would be.  The fingerprint biometric access is actually faster than the punch code sequence, as you have to tap a button to activate it, then enter the code and wait a second before it opens.Overall, if you need a secure place to store a handgun, this is a great option.

We have 4 cell phone users in the house who are always vying for outlets at night.  I also have a handful of nightlights around to prevent midnight injuries ;)  I like the idea of a combination unit!  It solves a problem (in that I do not have to unplug one or more nightlight so all of us can charge our phones), HOWEVER it is a very bright and harsh light, and not particularly attractive, or subtle (i.e., Some of the nightlights we have more or less \"disappear\" during the day).  This one looks like it should be in a warehouse, or on a runway.  The light is more or less par with that: very very bright.  We put it in a bathroom where we could close the door so we do not have to see the light, but it is a very harsh light to wake up to!On the positive side, it charges very fast, has a light sensor, and uses one outlet for 2 purposes.On the negative side, it is not shielded (neither electric surge nor usb /line noise) and so can easily fry your phone if there is a surge (we have them almost daily, most do not, so consider the risk for your particular situation).The light is very very bright, like a beacon or reading light more than a night light.The unit is not very attractive, nor is it a slimline, or a neutral color which will be unnoticeable like, for exampleFeit Electric NL1/LED Eternalite LED Auto Sensor Night LightorLeviton 48561-2W .5 W, 120 V, Automatic On/Off LED, Night Light with Etched Shade, 2-Pack, White.The 2 biggest issues for me are not what it looks like, but that it is a very harsh very bright light for a night light, and more significantly does not have shielding to protect your phone (or tablet...) from power surges.  If blackouts/ surges are not much of an issue for you, this is somewhat less important. (Our power fluctuates significantly daily, and I have had a number of losses as a result.  Anything electronic that we own must be plugged into a shielded outlet, with a surge protector or battery back up).I like the idea, and it could have been a problem solver for us.  It has features I look for, like a solar sensor, and uses one outlet for things we routinely use and otherwise would use 2 outlets for.  However is is not particularly good at either of it's functions.  It is too bright for a night light and too industrial and otherwise obtrusive (not slimline, or a neutral color) to blend into most home decor.  It does not have a surge or line noise suppressor which for me is a BIG con.  For those with more reliable power it may not be as big of an issue.  It does, however, take only 1 surge to destroy sensitive electronics.  i wish they had put a surge protector or noise filter on this so i could sleep better at night (providing the glare form the light didn't keep me up) ;)", "overall": 3.0, "reviewTime": "07 5, 2012", "summary": "A clever design, but harsh \"industrial\" lighting"}

I checked it against a trusted 48 inch level and was satisfied with the results.  Where the Bora disappoints, however, is when side pressure is applied.  With it clamped across a 4 foot piece of plywood, I can deflect the mid-point of the clamp 50 thousandths of an inch with firm pressure from my index finger. (Yes, I actually set up a dial indicator for this test).  That's almost 1/16 of an inch deflection.In the real world, if you don't apply undue sideways force as you make a cut, you'll get cuts that are straight enough for most applications.  If you want absolute precision and cabinet-grade final cuts, then this inexpensive clamp is not the best choice.It is much better suited to breaking down full sheets of plywood for easy transport.The clamping mechanism requires the user to operate it from both ends which can be a little inconvenient when dealing with wide workpieces.  The large locking handle is comfortable and makes locking the clamp easy.  But the width adjustment is at the other end of the clamp, which is potentially 50 inches away from the handle.  This isn't as big a problem as it sounds.  With a little practice, you can develop a two step process of hooking the unlocked clamp over the far end of the work and pulling the clamp until it drops onto the wood.  Retrieve the clamp to lock the opposite end and then reapply the clamp and lock it.If I was doing hundreds of cuts a day, that would drive me crazy but for breaking down one or two sheets of ply, it's doable.The Bora clamp is worth owning, but don't expect it to take the place of a $600 Precision Track Saw.Mike", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "10 23, 2013", "summary": "Good, but not great."}

If you need to tighten/loosen a nut that is lower to the ground, for example, you can bend the flexible head to produce an angle that is just right for optimal comfort. There is no special manuever necessary to move the head or special button to push. You just grab it and bend it the way you like.

The total length of this ratchet is about six and one half inches, but the handle, while easy to grip, is only about four inches in length. This could present a problem for those with larger hands. Small to medium size hands will not have any issues, but larger hands will have difficulty gripping the handle properly.

The Stylus Pro has been a staple of the flashlight community since it came out. Streamlight has updated the Stylus Pro, and it's a good thing...The Stylus Pro weighs just 1.7 ounce with the batteries installed. It's 5-3/8\" long and just over 1/2\" in diameter. That's pretty compact. The entire light is Type II anodized, and resists scratches nicely for such an inexpensive light. The blue color has a subtle \"rainbow\" effect with the machining lines showing, and I like it. The Stylus Pro uses a Cree XP-C emitter, but Streamlight calls it their \"C4\" LED. This emitter, coupled with the smooth reflector, give the Stylus Pro a nice, tight hot spot. It also introduces some visible rings, but they're negligible in real-world use. Output is double the old version of the Stylus Pro - 48 lumens. The lens is clear polycarbonate (plastic) and does its job. I have found that if you use the Stylus Pro around moisture, the water vapors can get between the lens and reflector, condensing the lens without a way to remove it. The light comes with two Energizer AAA batteries, and you should be able to get around 8 hours from a set.The tailcap screws on, and all four of mine came very dry and gritty. After some Tuff Glide, they feel much better. The pocket clip is mounted to the tailcap and can be removed. It's a bit too tight, as you'll have to be careful when screwing the tailcap on so you don't cross the threads. The clip is black, regardless of what color LED or body you choose. The light turns on via forward clicky switch. I like it, although some people have complained that the switch is too hard to press. The switch cover is replaceable by just unscrewing the top portion of the tailcap, and one spare switch cover is provided.  Also provided is a black nylon holster. It works just fine; light goes in, light goes out. It can fit a belt up to 1-3/4\" wide.I like the Stylus Pro in general. It's a good light.

That was the the problem most likely.  The other problem is that the clip isn't meant to have the tool on your belt or exposed.  It's supposed to go inside your pocket where it has a modicum of protection and the clip only allows it to ride at the top.  It's not meant to carry the full weight outside of a pocket or on a belt.  The pocket also provides protection of sorts from the blade opening inadvertantly.I don't use the lanyard ring very often, but when I do, I enjoy the quick release feature.

Reppen", "helpful": [8, 8], "unixReviewTime": 1231286400, "reviewText": "It's more powerful and cuts smoother than a crappy B&D; full-sized recip saw I got as a gift. Not that that's saying much.Vibration IS pretty crazy at top speed but with this much power and portability, something had to give and it certainly wasn't the quality or construction of the tool. Fortunately it's not a continuous thing. At lower speeds it's quite stable but around 75% on the trigger it starts to shake a bit and I'm not sure I'd feel comfortable using anything but two hands on it at top speed. I don't think I'd like it for repetitive use at top speed for long periods of time, but that's not really the kind of work this tool is meant for.So basically, if you want a finer cut, or decent control when cutting one-handed, you'll have to take it down a notch. If all you care about is making two pieces where there was once one ASAP, however, the option to go full bore is there and it cuts faster than I had hoped at this speed and still smoother than the B&D.; I've used it do a plunge cut through an inch of pine and I'm looking forward to trying out the wood scrolling blades when I get the chance since I can't really afford a jigsaw at the moment and the cuts seem pretty smooth at lower speeds.Which is the only really negative point for me. I like it just a little bit too much to give it up but I didn't really need it. I'm psyched to get that impact driver via the rebate and I love my subcompact drill/driver but as incredibly handy as it will come when I actually do have a use for it, there's other tools that would have been a better choice for me personally. That's more of a knock against me than the tool though and I suspect I'll feel less ambivalent when I start my first rehabbing project.Oh well, at least it replaces that ridiculous B&D; saw, which, incredibly enough, feels like a toy by comparison, both in the hands and during use. I can only imagine how much a corded or V28 sawzall outclasses the B&D.; But then I couldn't just throw one of those into a large inner trench pocket or a glove compartment.Usually people complain that the case didn't leave any room for extras like blades and other stuff. This case is nice and fits everything in the kit along with space to keep a full-sized blade in the tool during storage, a third battery and an extra pocket for more blades. If portability for transport is less of a concern, you'll probably like this case. Personally, I would have opted for one that sacrificed the convenience of not having to detach the blade and less space for extras in order to keep it smaller.Blade-swapping is about as easy as it could be. They pop out with a twist of a knob and pop in with even less effort and none of the uncertainty of a lesser tool. The ability to use full-size blades is nice in a pinch, I suppose, but I stick to the ones designed specifically for this tool as it has a noticeable impact on performance.If you've never encountered a Milwaukee sawzall in real life and it's the portability of this tool that appeals to you, I'd recommend having a look at a sawzall first. The best of the corded sawzalls is cheaper than this kit and they are already surprisingly compact tools for the amazing things they're capable of. If it has to be cordless, check out the V28 (but not the kit - it's priced more than its components cost separately).Overall, I'm very impressed, but let's be honest. If you're not sure you need one of these, you probably don't. If you're a member of any of the obvious professions Milwaukee has targeted with its m12 line, it's definitely worth a look.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "01 7, 2009", "summary": "Very Well-Made and Powerful for its Size - But Do You Need One?"}

I usually wind up just using a pair of scissors or a kitchen knife when I have to cut something open or score anything.This is a really nice utility knife, really nice.  It's got a rubberized coating which makes is both comfortable to grip and non-slippery.  It's sized so that it fits well in my hand, with curves and grips in the right spots.  The blades are easy to replace - no need to unscrew anything - lol.  The slide switch for the blade is on the left side, and seems to work well for either a right-handed or left-handed person.  It's a bit weighty (especially compared to my plastic box cutter) but the weight is distributed well and I think would actually be useful when used to score something because there would be less chance of wavering.  I've used it to open boxes and cut through plastic packaging with ease.The utility knife also can function as a wire stripper, and the packaging says that it can strip up to 12-gauge wire, not the 10-gauge mentioned in the Amazon description.  There's a notch on the underside that exposes a portion of the blade that allows you to strip wire.  The notch is recessed deep enough that there's no chance of accidentally cutting your finger. Also on the underside there is a storage compartment that flips open to store up to five new blades.  There is a magnet in the slot provided for the blades that holds them tight when the compartment is open, yet they are easy to remove.  The storage compartment opens smoothly and clicks shut.  The packaging states that the utility knife comes with a limited lifetime warranty, but doesn't state what the limitations are.This is a well-designed tool.  It also seems to be well-made.  I happened to get the tool free in order to review it, but it is something that I would actually buy; sure as heck beats my plastic box cutter.  I don't think that the Amazon price is expensive, considering the quality of the product and the likelihood that it will stand up to years of use.
