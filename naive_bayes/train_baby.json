I skipped the Bumbo, mostly because I had heard from friends with a chunky-legged munchkin that it's leg openings were too narrow (our little girl also has big legs) but compared three other seats.  We looked at the bebepod, the Mama's and Papa's seat (can't remember the name) and this one.  Ultimately, to my surprise, this is the one I came home with.  (I had planned to purchase the bebepod.)  Here's why:1.) Liked that the seat can grow with the child.  The Mama's and Papa's seat also had this option.  Both the Bumbo and the Bebepod are a one-time only fit...once your child is too big it's over.2.) Liked the tray and toys attached.  Not sure how I feel about the toys yet, I couldn't find anything that said they were BPA free which means I typically avoid them, although I know other Summer products are.  She's not able to play with them yet anyway since at nearly 12 weeks now she's only just beginning to be able to control her hands enough to bat something.  We'll see how it goes.  What we do like now is that I put the tray part in front of her and her light up musical turtle (Little Einsteins) and she loves it.  She can watch the lights go on and off to the music while sitting up independently and is starting to try and push the buttons.3.) This one had the highest back of the 4.  Since we were starting using it far earlier than recommended (this one says start at 4 mo, the others at 3) I knew the more support the better.  She has good head control, but can't control her core at all at this point.  Obviously we supervise her in this chair at all times, but it was nice that this one allowed her to be propped up.4.) Decent sized leg holes accommodate her chubby thighs.Some cons:1.) Not sure about quality of the materials.  I saw a review that said the paint wears off, which makes me a little nervous, but we will take a toy away if that starts to happen.2.) Floor use only really.  The base is wide, and it says it can be used for a booster later, but there are no straps to attach it to a chair, which would make me nervous.  For us this was a play seat only (she has a table-side seat for eating later) so we didn't care about that.  Your call if you plan to use it at a table.  (Bumbo has that lawsuit going because someone placed their child on a table in the seat, this one still looks wider and more stable but I'd proceed with caution.)3.) Super bright colors.  This can be a pro or a con.  Pro because it keeps baby's interest.  Con because it's another piece of rainbow plastic to add to your collection.  The Mama's and Papa's seat was a nice white.  (Although it didn't have toys, bebepod did.)Overall this one was the one that seemed to work best for us and so far it is something my daughter enjoys sitting in.

My baby is only 2 1/2 months old right now, and I find this mirror an irritation.  It takes 2 people to get the mirror placed so that the driver can see baby's face (one person in the back seat and the other in the driver seat).  The smiley face on the frog takes up valuable space.  When trying to get baby's face positioned in mirror, the smiley face frequently cuts straight through baby's face, making her facial expression impossible to see.  Hubby and I worked for 20 minutes to adjust this mirror so that Baby's face was visible from the driver's seat.  Once the baby's face is visible and the frog's smiley face is around the area of baby's neck, the picture is warped so badly that I feel like I'm watching the movie Alien.  I CAN see if baby's head is in the proper position and see if baby is smiling or frowning, making this semi-functional when mirror is placed right.  The biggest problem is that when someone sits in the back seat next to baby, they may touch the hand or foot of the frog as they are buckling themselves in.  If they do, then it moves the mirror and the quest to get the mirror placed correctly starts all over again.  I give this 2 stars because I expect as baby grows, her legs will be long enough to reach frog's belly, and she may find the toy interesting to play with.  At that point, I seriously hope I don't need to see her in the mirror anymore.", "overall": 2.0, "reviewTime": "10 5, 2008", "summary": "Hard to see baby in mirror"}

Fast forward, I am currently having a second child, and after much debate on car space and refusing to purchase another bulky infant carrier; I went with Britax Roundabout, instead of starting out with the new Graco Myride 70 (faints).

It was time to update his carseat.I looked up the Nautilus and thought it was a sure win. Of course here comes the debate between a fellow Graco lover and a Britax lover. After hearing their reviews and looking into some of my own (video mania), I ended up here, but not lightly. I tried to find the flaws even in the store, but there was none.t arrived in the mail about 3 weeks ago. The installation wasn't as easy as I thought it would be, but installing put Graco to shame. My son is absolutely excited to sit in it everytime we get into the car. It isn't a struggle to tighten the straps after putting him in, and it is difficult for him to escape this carseat in comparison to Graco. It takes me a little muscle to snap the button, so I know he doesn't stand a chance for now.My only complaint (not a big one or can be helped I guess) is when he takes a snooze, his head doesn't naturally fall to the side, it dangles to the front.

Currently, we mostly use the 5oz Medela bottles and 4oz cheap-o bottles that we got from the NICU.We don't exactly follow the grooves in the sterilizer and have found our own way of arranging the bottles and lids. We are able to sterilize 8 bottles and 8 lids at one time. We also sterilize my pump parts in here a couple times per week. We used to sterilize bottle nipples, but have not in a long time because our 6-month-old baby has a lot of health issues and actually lost the skill and desire to eat orally. We feed him everything through an NG tube right now. (It's hard, but that's the only way we can get him fed these days. Sniff, sniff.) It takes 3 minutes in the microwave, so it's pretty darn quick.Our only minor complaint about this sterilizer is that two of the grooves can sometimes cause the Medela bottles to topple.

This mattress is very sturdy and comfortable feeling. We bought a crib that converts to a toddler bed so we need a mattress that will last at least 3-4 years and be comfortable as baby grows.

I've always wanted a stroller with a higher seat so I returned it.I was very into JJ cole because the design of spinning the handle to change from rear facing to forward facing is so cool.

As you press on the \"lid\" it moves the plastic down and allows fluid to flow.  All other things constant, if you turn it upside down and do not touch the lid in anyway, no fluid comes out.In reality, once your little one figures out that when she presses on the lid when she's tipped the cup and fluid comes out, this will become a new game. :-)  Also, the drinking angle is a little awkward and though I don't have a way to measure flow it seems slower than a sippy cup (probably attributed to the drinking angle needed)Though the packaging states for 12months+, I think we might need to shelve these for a couple more months.I also took another star off because I've learned that even though you've assembled it the same way as you always have, to always test it by turning it upside down to see if it leaks before giving it to your little one.  One day I assembled it one way and then assembled it a different way and it leaked.  I took it all apart and reassembled it the very same way as the last time and then it didn't leak...who knows?  (I make sure the \"Avent\" label is readable from top when assembling and that seems to more consistently produce a leak free seal most of the time.)As we found with various sippy cup brands, you might be better off just buying a single one of these and just trying it, your results may vary greatly.  For us, we'll keep looking.  Actually, we've started to remove the rubber insert in sippy cups so it immediately flows so now she's learning she doesn't have to suck the fluid out, it will just flow out.  We think this will make for an easier transition to a traditional cup.

When she first began eating solids, we loved it because this chair allowed her to eat right at the table with us. It also doesn't take up additional floor space, which is great.After nearly a year of use, though, we now hate this chair. Our daughter is a fairly non-messy eater, yet the hippos, the metal parts, and the chair itself are always laden with gross food particles. The few inch gap between the table and the edge of the chair means that loads of food falls on the floor at every meal. Super gross. It is also ridiculously difficult to remove the cloth fabric from the chair frame in order to wash it. Worst of all, the frame part that locks onto the table will no longer unlock! Even my (quite strong) husband cannot get this thing off the table. When we recently moved to a new home, we actually had to move with the stupid hippo chair still attached to the table.Like I said, we are still using the thing, but it's more because we can't get it off the table than any other reason. While it is really nice to not have the chair take up extra floor space, that's really the only benefit to this chair. If you were only to use it now and then while on the go (and if you could get it off the table again), then it might be worth considering this. But it is a real headache of a high chair if you want to use it for daily use. Unless you think cleaning food up from the hippos and the floor several times a day sounds like fun, and unless you savor the idea of having to wrestle the cloth part off of the frame... and the frame off of the table... then I really wouldn't recommend this chair. It may be durable and space-saving, but the extra mess and work created is really not worth it.", "overall": 2.0, "reviewTime": "06 24, 2010", "summary": "terrible for long-term use"}

It tasted like I was drinking out of a smelly garbage bag.  The water tasted like disgusting plastic.  I know it is not the water itself since we used bottled water or filtered tap water.  I am not happy with this product or the money that I wasted on it.  I wanted to return them directly to ThinkBaby for a refund or to receive some sort of compensation (store credit towards something else like their lunch kits).I contacted ThinkBaby directly & they simply DO NOT back their products with a customer satisfaction guarantee.  Instead of empathy OR concern over the taste emitted, the company stated: &#34;One of the advantages of our plastic is that it does not release harmful chemicals.  The emails we typically receive our actually quite opposite. Folks are pleasantly surprised that the bottles don&#8217;t exhibit the typical taste.  Bottled water and filtered water can easily have flavor, and most of the materials used in those devices are completely suspect, especially PET.  The other area that any after taste could potentially come from is from the detergents used.  Washing the bottles with a chlorine based material could provide after taste.  We would recommend boiling the bottles and trying a dish detergent like Ecover or something by Seventh Generation.&#34;Other than the terrible taste, the actual cup is a nice design since it has fluid measurements on the side of it (which most sippy cups do NOT).  One downside is that the handle is hard to get lined up when you screw it all together.  I did NOT have tons of trouble with the &#34;nipples&#34; leaking, but it did leak some when the bottle was laid on it's side. Thinkster straw (conversion kit) is NOT easy to clean.  OVERALL, I would NOT recommend this product simply due to the taste of plastic.  They claim their product is safe, but I would never let my children drink from cups that make the water taste like this!  It is terrible.

Our son 'prefers' to sleep close to us at night, and there were nights before having this swing that we couldn't get him to sleep unless he was in our bed. We do not want to co-sleep for safety reasons, so we started looking at options. The Snugabunny swing has worked wonders to encourage him to be an independent sleeper, and now at 6 weeks, he is migrating to his crib.The option for swing direction is great. There are days that our son prefers the side to side motion over front to back swing. Admittedly, he is now getting bored with the mobile but the mirror is still stimulating. The music / sounds selection is also a little too limited, but we change it up with music from another source. Overall, has been a great product that has proven it's longevity. We purchased our swing as a used item and it survived a set of twins until they grew out of it. We have been using it very regularly for about 5.5 weeks and it has been a trooper.

The motor is super quiet compared to other models.  The cushioning on the seat is great. Baby sleeps very well in the swing. And when he is awake he loves to look at the mirror and watch the birds spin around.Since this swing is advertised as recline position only (the sales guy actually told me the seat could not be adjusted when I asked him) when my son was 4 months old I ordered Luv U Zoo cradle/swing so that he could sit upright in his swing.  I set that one up and it was just so loud (the motor) that I sent it back right away!  When you are used to a quiet motor there is no going back. Anyhow I decided to look at the swing to see if I could adjust the seat somehow and that's when I saw that the arm that holds the swing has 2 positions/holes just like the Luv u Zoo swing. Only on the cradle bunny swing it is hidden by hard plastic.  So I just pushed/bent the hard plastic to the side and adjusted the seat.  If you do this use a plier because it hurts when doing it by hand.Anyhow we have a great swing that I can recline or seat upright.  Perhaps they could of added a vibrate feature for the seat and a toy tray would be nice.

These are great to wear with a plain tee, they can make an outfit alone. They're really absorbent (I never use the second soaker) and the fabric is very smooth and soft. The hip bands are very nice and stretchy, and this is the most TRIM cloth diaper I've encountered, about the same as a disposable as far as I can tell. They're easy to wash and once you get the hang of it putting them on is quick too, great if you have a squirmy crawler.BUT:They take forever to dry- I dry all my diapers on high for 50 min (mostly TotsBots and Tiny Tush Elite)and these are the only ones that always need to be hung up to dry the rest of the way.The elastic has relaxed considerably over 9 mos- I'm guessing from the drying, even though they are often hung up.They ride low- I have some really cute pics of my son flashing crack in these. His thighs are pretty chunky so maybe that's why but he's a pretty average size kid these days so I wouldn't think it's him.They are very narrow in the crotch- I'm not sure which is more annoying, too wide or too narrow. It kinda makes the elastic dig into his inner thigh area on the newer ones that still have tight elastic. The relaxed elastic probably makes them more comfortable.The elastic is bulky- inner thighs and back of the waist always has a big imprint from the elastic when I take them off.When they're wet they feel WET- one pee and your soaked.You have to be careful snapping the bottom snap or you can pinch their thighs.Although Ive had no problems with leaking- and we dont use the second snap in soaker-I wouldn't recommend them for sleep because of how wet they feel.I can't comment on the ability to hold in poo, we're doing Elimination Communication and he doesn't usually poop in a diaper and never enough to \"blow out\"- I strongly reccomend ECing for everyone, especially cloth diapering parents. I don't have to rinse poo out of my diapers, need I say more?Overall, I prefer Totsbots / Tiny Tush for comfort and durability but these are the most stylish and easy to get on a squirmer.Update:This is the first diaper that we are retiring because of wear. After about 1 year the fabric covering the leg elastic is tearing and falling apart. Still looks nice on the outside though.Update:My son is almost 2 and we're still using all three of these that we bought! They look like crap on the inside but unless you really look at the gussets and the waistband you don't notice all the tears. The elastic is still a tiny bit stretchy in the other two but for some reason the owl diaper is just a limp noodle. They are really hanging on though. One big thing we have done is that for about the last 6 months they were almost exclusively line dried. Their absorbency is not as good without the elastic in shape but that's about it (besides the inside appearance of course).", "overall": 3.0, "reviewTime": "08 29, 2011", "summary": "Look great on"}

But we noticed that he always cough after drinking from Green sprout because he doesn't know how to control the water flow so we decided to use Nuk. Anyway, we eventually favor NUK better than Green Sprout sippy for the following reasons:1. Green Sprout Sippy's handle is not removable. It makes it hard to put it in stroller cup holders, side pockets of a diaper bag, or my purse. With NUK, I can easily put it in my purse without worrying leaking.2. Green Sprout Sippy's lid is very very hard to open. I have to spend 2 to 3 minutes to open it so that I can wash.3. Green Sprout Sippy's water gets dirty easily because the food in my son's mouth gets into the cup easily during drinking. I felt I have to dump the filtered water and wash it after every use.4. As mentioned above, my son get minor choke when drinking from it in the beginning. Now he is used to NUK and grown up a little (11 month old), he doesn't get choke anymore.5. You have to watch the baby during drinking then close the \"sippy mouth\" so that he can play with it. otherwise, my son would throw the cup or tile the cup and the water just leaks all over the place.Now, it basically being idled and only be used when one time I couldn't find the Nuk one.

It reclines far enough that my youngest can nap, and it isn't much longer than my single Graco stroller. Steering can be accomplished with one hand when needed, and the canopy is quite large. The parent organizer holds more than you'd expect, I routinely store my cellphone, keys, chapstick, compact camera and tissues in it, plus 2 drinks. My oldest is now 4 and likes to walk most of the time, but also still needs to rest on occasion. She loves being able to hop on and off with ease, standing or sitting. One thing I did purchase was a side slingJ.L. Childress Side Sling Stroller Cargo Net, Blackwhich my oldest uses for a couple small toys, her sunglasses and an extra juice box. I have it so that it is attached on the outside alongside the basket. The basket is quite large and sturdy but can be a pain to access, especially when a child is on the back. That is really my only complaint. It can be accessed from the side if need be as well. The Blueberry fabric has held up great and still looks like new, no fading, tearing, pilling or other damages I've experienced with strollers. It shows minimal dirt. Folding is easily accomplished and we fit it into the back of our Kia Forte regularly. The canopy comes off if you need it even more compact. The stroller is light weight, easy enough for us to carry up a few stairs when needed. I regularly recommend this to friends who are expecting their 2nd (or more) child. My children are 2 1/2 years apart and this stroller still works great for us. We especially like using this when we go to the Zoo or into NYC since we can store so much stuff in it and it's nice and light.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "03 1, 2012", "summary": "Adore this stroller"}

It might be better if the back were contoured a bit more but I did purchase it knowing that she would be growing into it. Also it is sometimes difficult to slide the upgrade tray on because her knees are in the way. I end up having to press her knees down to get the tray on. Again perhaps her knees are sticking up at that awkward angle because she is still a little small for the seat. Last but not least, while I like that this can be used on the floor on in a chair, if it is used on the floor there will be unsightly safety straps laying around.UPDATE: 12/22/2013 Her knees *were* sticking up because she was too small for the seat.

Arms are not held securely - it is easy for baby to get hands out the neck of the swaddle, and she's gotten a whole arm out once.

Can get loose around neck/face.Miracle Blanket: I do NOT recommend the miracle blanket. It is awkward to use, having to hold baby and wrap around and around and around, too many layers, yet comes undone.Standard Swaddle Blanket (I used Aden & Anais): I personally don't care for the blanket-style swaddles, which come undone easily, and then present a suffocation hazard with the loose fabric.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "03 23, 2014", "summary": "Nice Secure Swaddle"}

Otherwise I'd spend my money on some high quality flannel or jersey knit blankets. These are WAY overpriced for what they are, which is why I came to Amazon and got them for $30. They're basically huge pieces of heavy weight gauze with very stylish, trendy packaging and prints. I literally popped my finger through the blanket when pulling the blanket to tighten the swaddle on my son.BUT, I've had two babies in warm weather. They sweat in flannel receiving blankets, and they soon outgrow the size of stretchy jersey knit (i.e. Carter's) receiving blankets. I got flannel for my first child, and it took two blankets to hold the swaddle...she had wild arms and had to be swaddled for a long time. Both my kids are longer and couldn't sleep without keeping those hands away from their face (pinchers). She would sweat and sweat. We had to just swaddle her in her diaper, but she was still too hot. That was around the house, so she was really hot when we went out.So, I think they're way overpriced, and because of the material they are delicate. It's not that they're poor quality, its just they're muslin. That's the point of the material...to be breathable because when you swaddle them they end up with several layers of fabric around them. So, I can't rate it down because they're thin...that's the point. But, I do rate them at 4 instead of 5 because I think they're making money hand over fist for making a product that is new and trendy. Moms will do anything to make they're baby comfortable, and we love cute patterns...end of story. I hope these will eventually come down in price after they're on the market for several years because they are very functional.These are huge too and lose their shape after several uses, but most non-flannel swaddling blankets do. I like that they're huge because my kids are longer and otherwise they're feet bust out. These are lightweight enough that if I have to I can swaddle their arms over their sleep sack until they get to sleep.

To rule out any problems with the monitor, I tried plugging it into the power cord/adapter for the camera.  That worked.  So for a couple weeks I would plug the monitor into the camera power cord to charge it while my son was awake (when we wouldn't need it).  And in the meanwhile I called Levana.  I called.  I emailed.  I used their contact request form on their website.  They are impossible to get a hold of.  Finally after about a week of trying, I got a call back. I explained the situation.  Since it was literally just a few days after the one year warranty expired, they agreed to send me a new power cord.  I thought my problems were solved.  But last week, the monitor stopped holding its charge.  I haven't even gotten my replacement power cord yet.  I would have thought that something of this price would not only offer a better quality product but also better customer service.

I loved this bouncer, but have given up on exchanging the item. I just returned it for the last time and will be purchasing a different bouner.5/16/11: They have 2 other bouncenetts that look similar, but neither one has the bounce in the seat (only the virbation). Make sure to pay close attention to what the seat does before purchasing in order to make ensure you get the seat you want. This was exactly what we wanted because it can vibrate when the baby is too young to bounce and it can bounce as the baby acquires that ability. Additionally, the mobile is detachable, so it can be on or off depending on the situation or age of baby. Very soft material, detachable seat cover for washing, not too large overall.Complaint: the assembly directions aren't great in respect to step #6. There are these small latch-like items that attach to the metal frame (I assume to keep the bouncer in tact), but the directions for attaching them and the picture to follow is horrible.

Our little one's head would drop quite a bit while sleeping in the swing (for a while he would only sleep while swinging--had to break that habit), and we were once concerned that he was slightly cutting his airway off. Scared us quite a bit so we always used receiving blankets to keep his head in place the way a lot of people do in car seats until he had good head control and grew into the seat better.

However, one of the things that drew us to Peg Perego is the quality of the materials. We felt the plastic seemed much more durable then the Chicco and Graco ones.Our biggest complaint is that you need two hands to move the handle and even with two hands it sometimes doesn't want to cooperate and can be a bit challenging to move when the seat is in the car and you're leaning over it trying to push the button on the far side.

It combines the security of a permanent mount with the relative ease of installation and occasional portability of pressure-mounted models.I had two irregular doorways to fill in with child gates so our scootching 13-month old could play safely in the area. For one large opening I used the SuperYard Gate, which is a decent all-plastic telescoping gate with permanent-mounting rails, and for the other I used the First Years hands-free with a single extension. After seeing how secure the First Years was, and how incredibly east it was to install the extensions, even though I'm happy with the SuperYard Gate, I wish I had bought two First Years Hands-Free,The operation is really cool -- you step on a pedal, and knee the thing open. It works in both directions! I was skeptical the pedal was baby-proof, but letting my son (who is the median weight of a two and a half year old) put his full weight on it didn't budge it a bit.  The design is also very attractive; nice thin white metal instead of the usual lattice-work plastic on most gates.One comment on an earlier negative review, where the Grandparent indicated their 15-month-old could pull up the foot pedal: this cannot open the gate if the top is properly tightened! (See below). I tried this, and the pedal will slide but not allow the gate to open if the top is tight.I have only a few minor caveats to convey:- when installing it, make sure you follow the instructions and use the little plastic wrench (included) to do some fine-tuning tightening, so that the upper latch is the required distance from the catch (a wrench-width). This is easy to do, and I found that when I tightened it up as the instructions indicated, the good fit of the latch became excellent even with a slightly-irregular-from-vertical door post.- the opening might be a little narrow compared to some other gates; it took a bump or two on my calf to get the hang of, nothing terribly difficult or painful.- the extension might not be necessary if you have an opening that's right on the cusp of the suggested 29-34\" door opening; if you  have an opening right around the maximum, I'd recommend installing it without the extension first to avoid having to make a return for a possible un-needed extension. Installing and de-installing the extension, as I noted, is a piece of cake.- this is not \"portable\" the way a simpler gate is, but can be de-installed and re-installed in less than two minutes. Since it swings open, if you want to use the gate in only one location, the portability isn't an issue.All in all, just about the coolest gate I've used.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "03 10, 2005", "summary": "I Cannot Believe What a Good Gate this is...!"}

Everything from the seams to the snaps are top notch.  In addition, the onesie fits kimono style, so there is an extra layer of fabric over baby's tummy.  Sure, they are more expensive.

I can pump directly into the liners, seal them up and then just pop them into a bottle at feeding time.  The bottles themselves have slow-flow nipples, which I find are very easy for my baby to nurse from.  However, this is definitely a \"starter\" set, and anyone who wants to use this system for all their bottle needs will have to make several additional purchases.  First of all, only one of the four bottles in the set (an eight ounce bottle) has the slide at the bottom to squeeze the air out of the liners.  Even with the short four-ounce bottles, when the liner gets up toward the top I couldn't get my fingers in far enough to squeeze out the air that had accumulated inside.  So, I would recommend buying a couple of more of the bottles with the slide to make it easier to squeeze air out of the liners.  Also, there are only two storage caps included in the starter set - you will definitely need more to amass any sort of milk supply.  These have to be bought in \"kits\" with Drop-Ins liners (but you'll need extra liners anyway as they're disposable, so that won't go to waste).  However, in every kit there's also a breast pump adaptor included.  This seems like a waste to me since you don't really need more than two of those.  I would like to be able to buy the storage caps separately.  Otherwise, though, this really is a nice way to see whether this system will work for you without investing a lot of money up front but still getting a little bit of everything you would need.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "05 21, 2005", "summary": "Great product but definitely a \"starter\" set"}

So I think it's safe to say I've had more than my share of experience when it comes to foam mats.  These have a good color variety, but that's about it.These mats are almost identical to another set we have by a brand called Norsk, with the following differences:* Norks Mats are much cheaper (we got ours in 6pks from Kmart a while ago, no longer available there, but they are sold in 4pks directly from Norsk for $16; free shipping if you buy 2 or more; so you'd get 8 pieces for just $2 more than this set)* The Norsk mats are slightly thicker - just barely (described as being 1/2\" thick, but are just under that really - but still thicker than these, which are described as being 3/8\" - I've laid them down next to each other to check this).* The Norsk Mats only include 4 colors (red, green, yellow, blue); I admit - I much prefer the color variety of these mats, but not enough to justify the price difference.Here's the Norsk Mats on Amazon - but if you go to their website you'll see they're sold for just under $16 - but with free shipping (when buying 2+):Norsk-Stor 240147 Solid Color Recyclamat Multi-Purpose Foam Flooring, Multi-Color, 4-PieceThe best mats we own are the ones by Edushape.

We own two of them (well - technically three - but 2 different types) - 2 of these:Edushape Edu-Tiles 25 Piece Solid Play Mat with Edges & Corners(which were price slightly lower than they are now when we bought them - $18/piece) and after getting these we decided to also get their alphabet mat:Edushape Edu-Tiles 36 Piece 6x6ft Play Mat, Letters & Numbers Set.

That's not a problem with this mat - the only reason the letters come out is because my son has taken them out.And the last brand we've tried is the tadpoles brand.  I suggest avoiding them entirely.  We owned two of these mats & had pitched them both within months.  They look really cute - have great color schemes - but unless these are not going to be in a high traffic (or high-play) area - they're completely useless.  After a few weeks ours would not stay together and my son wasn't even crawling yet - meaning he would sit in one area at a time & they were coming apart just from us walking around on them.  The ones we owned (& threw out) were theTadpoles 36 Sq Ft ABC Floor Mat, Green/Brownand theTadpoles 16 Piece Squared Playmat Set, Blue/Brown.  Both a complete waste of money.  Maybe if you're just using this for a visiting grandchild or relative - but otherwise, don't bother with these.So - overall - these mats are OK...the only real complaint I have is the cost since these are comparable to the cheaper alternative I already own.  But the colors are great, the set is a big one that covers a good space, and if it weren't for the lower price elsewhere I really wouldn't have anything negative to say about these.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "02 12, 2014", "summary": "Good mat, but a bit pricey & on the thin side."}

When he was tiny he'd stare at it and now he plays with it so very happily while I change him. He loves to pull the mirror down and chew on it and turn it all different directions. He can pull the ball and make the pinwheel spin over and over...I'm really shocked by how well he can already work these things. He actually gets excited about a diaper change...that's amazing...no crying baby to attempt to change (most of the time...no one is perfect). I HIGHLY recommend buying this toy arch. It is very versatile...the screw-tightening clamps turn around to attach easily and the arch bends in about 4 places so you can lower it closer to little baby arms. Also, some have voiced concern over the very fast spinning pinwheel worrying it may hurt, but it does not at all. Somehow the plastic is VERY soft and you can stick a finger in it at the fastest speed and barely feel it...I think the way it's set to spin with the string pull makes it stop very quickly/easily if touched.

I got this same model but in the Elm color scheme from babies R us.While setting up my registry, to save money I did not go for a travel system, instead I got: the Chicco Key fit 30, an extra base, the Chicco key fit caddy, and a full size/ semi jogging stroller made by Jeep.  Everyone on Amazon and Babies R Us complained that these Chicco full size strollers were heavy and bulky so I figured if I was going to do heavy and bulky I would just go with a jogger.  Once my son outgrew his infant bucket car seat the key fit caddy (which I loved btw) became useless.  After getting sick of lugging the jogger around everywhere we purchased 2 umbrella strollers (meh!) and a $100.00 Ergo carrier which my son is meh about.  So much for $$ savings.  Enter this stroller once we realized that the umbrella strollers weren't going to work for us.  I wish I had just gone with the travel system to begin with.  I tell you this stroller is not heavy, or bulky, or a pain to take around with you.  I'm 5.4 and I never was a big fan of the gym.  I can easily take this out of my trunk, unfold it, then fold it back up and put it in my trunk with one hand while holding my wiggly 13 month old son and a diaper bag in the other hand.  It truely is one hand operation.My husband easily put it together in just a few minutes.  I love that the sun canopy is adjustable.  The stroller has a 5 point harness with cushy shoulder strap pads.  The cup holders for mom and babe are great.  The stroller rides smooth on paved surfaces and glides on indoor surfaces.  Nice suspension.  I love that the seat can fully recline although my son is not a stroller napper, its still a nice feature.  It's also easy to clean, my son gets all kinds of crumbs and junk in here on long walks but everything easily wipes off with a baby wipe.The biggest pro is that I can tell my little one is comfortable in here.  With the jogging stroller he is still too small for it and he just sloshes around and seems uncomfortable.  Umbrella strollers arent really meant for comfort for the rider or pusher.If there is one critisicm I would say that the basket could be a little bit bigger, it barely fits my diaper bag.  Also, one of the waist straps (I think on the left side) is oodly short, and can't be adjusted.  I'm going to call Chicco about this because it seems like a defect.  I regret not having this when my little guy was a newborn but I know it will last for future babies.  I also regret not getting the travel system because now I have a stroller that doesn't match my infant car seat.

The nipples are fast flow.The procedure to unseal and reseal the bag to get out the bottles is straightforward, although probably not necessary. Once you open the bag it is no longer sterile. The need to carefully and only partially unzip the packaging for the nipples is tedious. The nipples leak very little when the bottle is inverted, but when feeding, the flow is very fast (too fast, much faster than a Playtex fast flow nipple).The biggest surprise was that once you put the nipple on the bottle, you can't take it off. I discovered this while testing it empty and had to waste a bottle and nipple. This means you can't \"top off\" a bottle, or add something to an already made bottle. Forcing the nipple off the bottle breaks the sealing mechanism and renders the bottle useless. The bottle is recyclable, but not reusable.

I'm assuming it was due to the stress.  While I was at the hosptal, I used their Ameda Elite hospital pump, but at home, I was pumping full time with this pump.  It gets the job done quickly and the handle is very comfortable.The milk can leak out the sides, which can be very upsetting, especially if you're pumping for a hospitalized newborn and you need every drop you can get.  You just have to make sure to keep the pump perfectly upright.  Don't tilt it at all!I didn't have any problems with creaking, and if I did, I'd just take it apart and put it together and the problem was solved.I also know some had problems with the milk getting backed up and the silicone star not letting the milk flow to the container, but you just have to be sure to release the handle completely so the milk can flow out.  Another way to get it into the container is the break the suction between the pump and breast and pump the handle a few times.This pump worked great and I was able to come up with ways to avoid problems until I had used it (full time) for a month and a half.  The star would start getting sucked up into the top even if I slightly pumped the handle.  I emailed Avent and they emailed me back and had some great tips (great customer service, by the way!).  They said to boil the silicone parts for 10 minutes in water and 2 teaspoons of white vinegar... and viola! Problem solved.  If you use it as much as I did, the tackiness of the silicone wears and has to be fixed by the boiling.Lastly, I read some had problems getting everything to fit in the bag.  It takes talent, I tell you!  My advice is this: Remember how it was packaged in the first place!  Before you take it out of the bag, take note of how it's arranged.  After several attempts, I finally got it all back in.All in all, it's a great pump if you don't want to invest in an electric pump, or if you're only pumping occationally and you work around some of the little issues.  In those instances, I'd definitely recommend it!  I have an Ameda Purely Yours as well, and overall, I'd suggest paying the extra money and get an electric if you're working or having to pump full time, or you just want more convience.I hope this review helps, as I wanted it to be my best, considering all the experience I've had with so many pumps!", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "04 10, 2005", "summary": "Great Pump, but Has Little Quirks"}

We started with the Playtex Drop-ins.  I have been very happy with those bottles, but sometimes I hate dealing with the inserts.  These are the narrow nipple unlike the drop-ins, so the nipples are not interchangeable.  I do like these because the top will screw directly onto a ready-to-feed bottle (I use Similac) and I don't have to use one-time use nipples.I was really hoping the bottle would be easier for my son to hold on to since it is angled, but I think he just likes me holding it, so he has yet to hold the bottle himself.  I do find it much easier for me to hold when he is laying down because I can move around and it fits perfectly under my chin or it sits at he correct angle without me having to hold it at all unlike a straight bottle that falls over easily.The bottle unscrews at both the top and the bottom.  The bottom has a seal in it that pops out easily and is simple to clean.  They wash up quickly.  The bottles do not fit into my Avent microwave sterilizer.  They are just a little too tall for it.My one complaint is that the bottles come with fast-flow nipples.  My son is a medium-flow bottle eater.  Fast is just too fast for him.  He moved up to the medium at 2.5 months, but I don't see him moving up any time soon. I would prefer they come with medium since that would be used more frequently to begin with when moving up to the larger bottles.Overall, a great bottle.  I suggest picking up some medium-flow nipples if your little one has been using slow-flow since fast-flow can be a big jump.  If I had to choose between this one and the wide bottle, I would pick the wide.

It is also great for traveling when visiting relatives for quick trips or over night sleep over's at grandmas.  It gives baby a constant security even in a different sleeping environment.  It has a convenient battery operated night light at the head of this product that makes it easy to check on baby in the middle night with out waking him with the bright lights of turning a lamp on.The only downside is that the waterproof padding (that comes with it) is not so comfortable and is on the stiff side even if it's covered by a washable cotton cover (also provided with the product).  Luckily my Mom improvised by cutting out some memory foam from an old bed liner she had in the shape of the liner that comes standard with this sleeper.  The new cushion she created fit perfect in this and has completely improved the comfort of this sleeper for my baby.  The foam also prevents flat head syndrome and now it's the perfect product for me and my baby.  Another con is its size and most babies will definitely outgrow this after 6 months.So far it has been worth it for me as it gives my baby a safe and secure place to sleep peacefully no matter where we are for the night.

I ordered this and gave it a shot-with great results.  The size was perfect (started around three months), and I think the nubby texture felt nice on his gums (he had his first tooth at four months). A child can chew on the 'berry' itself, as well as the leaves and back handle--all have a rubbery texture that seems very soothing. Sometimes I even stuck this in the fridge for a little while and he had something nice and cool to chew on. This and the Mam teethers were mainstays for us throughout the teething process.  I personally prefer this one until baby has a better grip-it's easier for parent or child to hold onto, and even goes on those little loops  to keep pacifiers safe.  Our first one held up well to pretty serious usage, and when it was lost we immediately purchased another. The only negative is the handle-not quite as sturdy as the est of the pacifier, and on one it did pull apart.

It seems silly to use the car seat for a few months then buying a new one, which is the case if you get an infant car seat.The car seat is a little pricey but considering we're only buying one (no infant car seat!) and we can use it up to 6 years, it's a pretty awesome buy. Our unit comes with the TinyFit system, which is extra padding that can be taken out once the baby exceeds the weight limit. It helps our 7lbs baby sit comfortably on his way back from the hospital.Our baby sleeps very well in it. The car seat is BIG but it still leaves a bit of space for the front passenger to move. Usually we'd make sure we feed him full of milk so he'd be sleepy and ready to sleep once we're in the car. and the cup holder is a great thing to have, I usually put his bottle/rattle in it. Makes it easier to have it right by him. I'm sure he will appreciate it once he is older.The seat looks very comfortable. The release button is VERY hard to operate, I usually have to press really hard but with a little practice, am getting better at it.

Haven't used the comb or the cradle cap comb either. We have found that washing her hair at least every couple days and massaging her scalp during her nightly baths has kept cradle cap away.The digial thermometor is good - it can be used under the arm, or with a prob to be used rectally. We have only used it under her arm as we have a red cross temporal thermometor that works great and can be used while she is sleeping without waking. This is important if baby hasn't slept much due to fever.The medicine \"bottle\" is a joke - I use it to store small amount of breast milk for cereal. My daughter has had to have antibiotics once, and she gets tylenol regularly for teething pain - we use the dosage things that came with the medications. This I could understand being useful if you have to give a few ML's of something when baby is 1 or 2, but it's completely useless for us.The nasal aspirator is also a joke. The plastic part disonnects from the \"bulb\" almost every time we have tried to use it. My daughter was in day care at 8 weeks until just before Christmas, so she had her share of colds and needed a nasal aspirator frequently. This thing would come apart every time we tried to push the bulb in to get a good suction. My advise is throw it away and buy a \"little Noses\" stuffy nose kit with saline drops and a nasal aspirator. That one has worked wonders for us, along with an electronic one.Toothbrush - My daughter is 5-1/2 months and doesn't have any teeth - We have this set aside for when she gets her first tooth, but let her play with it to \"clean\" her gums so she is used to it.Alcahols swabs - These are good to clean off the thermometor after each use.Hope this helps someone!", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "01 10, 2013", "summary": "Some items great, and some items not so great"}

I was looking at Motorola, but didn't want to overpay for the functions I thought I won't use (tilt/pan, room temp), so I decided to go with this simpler and cheaper monitor.Here is the quick summary:pros: the video quality is goodcons: sound quality is HORRIBLE. Even with the sound turned on to the max you can barely hear that your child is crying if you have TV or music turned on, or if you're in the kitchen and have running water. It also has a lot of static noise in the background which makes it really hard to hear what's going on in the nursery.. If you're monitoring a younger baby, it's OK, but my older one likes to talk a lot before falling asleep and after waking up, and I can't understand what she is saying, even when I listen very careful.If you have a few cameras, the monitor won't automatically switch between them when the noise is detected. Right now I have my kids sleeping in separate rooms and I need to constantly manually switch between cameras to check on them.The monitor is very light, in fact it's so ridiculously light that it's own cord drags it down from my nightstand!Camera's cord is very short.I kinda regret now that I decided to save money and went with this option.

Expensive, but I figured I would pay top dollar for something relatively safer and \"cleaner\" than standard typical mattresses. Well, I recently purchased the matching waterproof mattress cover from Colgate and was surprised at what I found. It is sold as \"organic cotton\", however the label stated 100% polyester. I called the company and they did not have a good answer for me. The woman said, \"Oh no it's organic cotton. Maybe it's the wrong label, but that doesn't matter anyway because you cut it off after you get it.\" NOT THE RIGHT ANSWER. I am paying a premium for a product advertised as organic cotton, yet the label doesn't state something like -- 100% polyester (exclusive of surface) or anything like that. If you are selling a product as organic cotton, you definitely would be stating that on the material label as other companies do.SO... now that made me suspect of this mattress, which states (and looks) like the same \"certified organic cotton\" surface. I looked at the material label on the mattress and it states \"92% Urethane foam 8% Rayon\". Once again, where is the organic cotton????!!!!I really wish the company would address this issue. I highly doubt that these are all errors on the labels. If you really have a product made with organic cotton, you state it.Original review: I spent a long time researching different crib mattresses. I have two cribs and initially received a different brand because it was the best available at Babies R Us. I kept that mattress for my secondary crib, but wanted to find a more natural, organic one that would serve as my infant's main crib mattress. I purchased this one several months ago and am very happy with it. There are two sides of firmness, to different degrees - one for a newborn and one for a toddler (they are both firm though.) There are no sagging spots and all crib sheets seem to fit perfectly on this mattress. There is no plastic odor like with some mattresses and this was very important to me. The mattress itself is soft and plush, but not waterproof, so make sure you buy a waterproof lining for under your sheets. This may negate the whole organic thing, but I don't want to ruin an expensive mattress after one accident.", "overall": 2.0, "reviewTime": "02 15, 2013", "summary": "I THOUGHT I was very happy with this mattress, HOWEVER deceptive advertising?"}

Charlie Banana wipes are better suited for cleaning delicate areas without causing irritation - or for when changing a wet diaper.They hold up nicely in the wash.

Instead of needing added software through a computer, it does it all standalone.I'm a big fan of Foscam and they are the cheapest option that I have, but they are a little more complicated to install for use outside of your network.

It's definitely more about comforting than entertaining. The fabric is very soft and the seat is very deep and enveloping compared to most bouncers. It does bounce if baby gets energetic, but not on its own, however you can bounce it gently yourself with very little effort. It has a volume control for the music (soothing melodies) and sound effects (rain, water and something which sounds like a heartbeat) and a gentle vibration feature. The structure seems very stable and I can't imagine it could tip easily, if at all. I have mostly used it for my little one to nap in during the day (never unattended). The heartbeat sound particularly seems very soothing for her and she's able to snuggle down in the seat like she would in my arms. It allows me to put her down somewhere comforting for an hour and keep an eye on her so I can get a few things done, or sit down for a minute. I do wish the sound would go on a little longer - it shuts off after about ten minutes to save battery power - but other than that I wouldn't change a thing.Edited 3/3/2008 to add: My daughter is now 7 months old and we still use this every day. She doesn't sleep in it any more but uses it like a chair (it has two settings, reclining and upright). It has enough room for a few toys of her own, and she recently discovered the toy bar and loves the little bug, which she can now pull off with a bit of work. Now she's older she enjoys the music though we still use the heartbeat sound for background if she's having trouble dozing off for her nap. Also, in 7 months we have NEVER had to change the batteries.

I'll mention some reasons below that we really like this seat.Assembly: this was very easy, the cloth fit over it perfectly, and the toy/accessory snapped into place without problem.Recline Mode: If you look at the photo, you will notice that toward the front at the bottom there is a bar that goes from side to side. This is a \"kick stand\" that can be pulled down to lock the seat into a sturdy reclining mode which also prevents the rocking. It made such a huge difference for her to lay in a reclined position, especially if she's taking a short nap, it added at least another hour of well needed rest. Additionally its nice to let them lay back as they can't support their neck very well early on. The rocking position however is very nice when she is in a playful mood.Seat adjustment: Not only does this allow a stabilized reclining position, but the back of the seat itself is also adjustable, although not by much. You push the two large green buttons on the sides at the same time and the back can move one unit forward or one unit back. What I don't like about this is that if your using both hands already to push the buttons in, how do you move the back of the seat at the same time to position it ? Well somehow I'm able to get it but kinda strange, should have it only on one side to free up one of your hands. We use mostly the reclined position when thinking to change posture.Toy: comes with a nice attachment with toys that suspend from above that your little one can play with. It also has a little handle that when she pulls it, a short song is played. This helps her learn cause and effect.Vibration Mode: The seat does have a similar button that allows the seat to vibrate. I don't know why but this calms them down and gets them to sleep quickly. She loves it.Cloth: The cloth is very easy to remove and wash. This is super important as you can imagine. It also has the usual safety straps (seat belt) built in to secure your child.Mobility: The seat is not that heavy and easy to lift. You can also slide or push it easily across the carpet to move it however note that you cannot do this while its in the stabilized reclining position because the white rubber at the bottom prevents this.Overall: This is a great seat. We returned the previous one that we purchased which was slightly smaller and only had a little bit of a bouncy/springy effect and purchased this one instead. The quality and features on this one make it way better and if you have tried other seats, i'm sure you'll understand why.Happy shopping for your little one,George", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "12 28, 2013", "summary": "Better than the bouncy seat !"}

We have 2 very active little boys who are 3 and 5 and we added a girl to our brood.  We bought a Balboa Baby Sling and really liked it, but it was harder on me than my husband.  I am \"shorter than average\" at 5'2\", but have a short torso even for my height.  This has always presented a challenge for slings because I am *ahem* top heavy, as well.  HotSlings and other pocket slings never worked - by the time I found one that could acomodate my chest, our daughter was hanging at my thighs and wasn't secure.  I loved the Balboa baby carrier, but even on the shortest setting, it put a lot of the baby's weight on my lower back.  With the Moby wrap, you wrap it to fit YOU, so it's always the right size.  My husband is 9 inches taller than I am and he can wear it, take it off, and hand it to me.  I just re-wrap it.  There are no \"but I just got it to the perfect size\" moments, which I LOVE.  I perfected 3 carries in about 20 minutes with our 6 month old.  I will add that 1.) I had already gotten used to different carries with our Balboa sling; 2.) our baby has been worn since she was born, so she was very patient and actually seemed excited once we started trying the wrap styles with her; 3.) I did it right after she has nursed when we didn't need to go anywhere, so there was no pressure to hurry up and figure it out.  I can see where it may look daunting, but seriously, I am clumsy and a perfectionist, and I felt very comfortable after going to the Moby website and getting instructions on wraps and holds.  Because you can smooth the fabric out across your back, the weight distribution is AMAZING.  I wish they would invest something like this for pregnancy!  I don't feel any \"tugging\" on my shoulders, or that dull ache in my lower back.  It's really nifty.It *is* a bit warm, but honestly, you're baby-wearing.  Babies are like little furnaces.

It has an open side on the clip, which allows you to easily attach it to something.  I also bought the NUK carrier, and it's pretty much the same thing (just more expensive).  Size wise, it also only fits one pacifier so if you're looking for something to fit two pacifiers, you will need to keep looking (or just use a Ziploc bag).", "overall": 3.0, "reviewTime": "06 26, 2013", "summary": "Definitely not for two pacifiers"}

They have the exact same one at her day care, which made it easy to convince her to use it at home.

Since then, she's used the seat without complaint.  She likes having the handles to hold on to, and it fits my elongated toilet seat just fine.  The only complaint I have is that the underside of the seat has some sort of plastic gridlike framework underneath that always manages to get pee on it.  I just wish the underside was smooth so it was easy to wipe down underneath, so I just rinse it off in the tub when it gets gross.  Otherwise it's perfect!  We have two, one for each bathroom.

After looking at a couple older infant-to-rocker models, it is clear that Fisher Price found a way to further increase the stability of the rocker in the front. They include longer plastic pieces that attach to the base frame, lengthening the front (to greatly lessen the chance of forward flipping).The vibration of the seat is strong (though it only comes with one setting). I am able to comfortably rock it with my feet from the side while sitting in a chair or at the edge of my bed. It rocks smoothly-even on our carpeting. The rocking motion I use reminds me of an old fashioned sewing machine you work with your feet. I really love that it can handle 10-15 lbs. more weight than most swings(up to 40lbs).I like that it assembles quickly without a lot of pieces, so I can easily break it down to fit in a suitcase for travel (especially since it does NOT fold up when fully assembled). The seat cover is soft enough. It attaches with clasps in the back and comes off easily for washing. You can tuck the harness and straps completely through slots in the seat. This way, it is able to \"disappear\" when being used as a toddler rocker.There is an underside bar that swings forward in order to set the chair in a fixed recline. There are strong written warnings against using this for prolonged periods of sleep. The chair has an incline/decline feature. You have to depress both large green buttons (one on each side of the chair). This is fairly easy to do. There are visual markings (also on both sides) that indicate which setting the seat is in.The main issue I have is with the toy bar. These are hard plastic pieces that roughly swing in baby's face-even when gently rocking the chair. This is not soothing. Though I'm glad there's no possibility of one flying off (they are molded to the bar). It is frustrating that I cannot take these off to clean well or change them out for softer toys-or anything else, once baby gets bored.Unfortunately, the rocker squeaks when I rock it, but ONLY when the toy bar is on (the squeaking is coming from where the white plastic ends of the toy bar lock into the sockets affixed to the frame).There is no quiet way to take off this toy bar once baby is asleep. It is jarring. You also have to get a good, firm grip on both sides of the toy bar in order to get it off. Often, the bar catches on one side or the other if I'm not really careful.The toy bar's flat square and rectangle pieces have lion and giraffe STICKERS instead of being toy animals that can be held, so the play is limited. The cleaning challenge regarding stickers is also something to consider.I also noticed that the shapes of these paddles actually have a fanning effect when the seat is being rocked. Other family members can feel a definite chill coming from them swinging back and forth-not good for baby, especially in colder climates.There are hard plastic circles affixed to the top of the animal panels and elephant toy with smaller plastic dots along the actual bar. The 3 main (larger) circles have numbers \"1,\" \"2\"and \"3\" engraved upon them. It would have been better if the actual numbers stood out more, so that baby can clearly see them (with different colors in print like the dots on the elephant). However, I am thankful that the numbers are engraved rather than also being stickers.The middle elephant is the heaviest piece on the toy bar. It takes three \"Button Cell Batteries\" that are included, though I wish they were a common battery type that the average person has on hand, to easily switch out. If you lightly grab the ring that dangles below it (with two much smaller rings attached), a couple bars of ONE song plays \"Skip to My Lou.\"In all, I like the rocker itself, but the toy bar is disappointing.", "overall": 3.0, "reviewTime": "02 1, 2013", "summary": "Toy Bar Needs Improvement"}

These launder great, get softer and more absorbent with each wash, and still look really good after five months of continuous use.

This product was recommended by a lady whom my husband and I took the infant care/breast feeding class from.  I wasn't so sure if this thing was going to work because all other moms that I knew had boppy pillow; no one had this one.  I didn't want to spend much money on something that might or might not work, so I went with the cheap solution-- I bought the inflatable my breast friend travel pillow.  When my baby was born and I started to use it, I immediately fell in love.  It was supposed to be \"travel\" pillow, but I used it at home.  It helped tremendously with breastfeeding.  I would have given up breastfeeding if I had not had this pillow.  After almost 10 months of use, the cover started to show some wear and zipper for the cover was hard to close.  After 12 months, zipper just broke.  Around the same time, the pillow started to deflate.  I found the location of the leak, but I was unable to fix it.  Oh well, I only paid 20 dollars for this inflatable pillow, so I got my money's worth and I had no complaints  I did breastfeeding until my baby was 18 months.  After 12 months, I didn't really have to have the pillow because I knew how to breastfeed and the baby was getting big and I could feed the baby without the support of the pillow( and by this time baby eats food, so you don't have to breastfeed as much anyway). .  Last year when I found out that I was pregnant with my second baby, one of the first items that got on my \"must have\" items was my breast friend pillow.  This time, I knew this thing works and I did not hesitate to spend 40 dollars for it.  This Time, I went for the deluxe.  I have a six month old baby and I use this daily.  I told my friends about this pillow and they went for this pillow instead of boppy pillow.

I went back and forth between this and the bjorn, but I kept reading reviews that the kids were sitting on the bjorns splash guard and getting scared of the potty. I was pleased to find this new frog model because the built in guard is slightly narrower than the old frog (that one has a guard shaped like an \"m\" and dips between the eyes). I like that it is not as wide as the old one because they don't have to spread their legs as far apart.

We have been using this for less than a week and she already stays dry most of the time. She takes off for this cute little froggie when she has to go because it is so fun! I am still careful to help her sit so she doesn't sit on the guard and become afraid of the potty, but I definatly would rather do that than clean pee from the floor!

I did a TON of research before deciding to try Softbums.  I chose this system bc it seemed like the easiest way to go and the system my husband was most likely to buy off on.  He did.  We have only been using them for a few days, but we are both completely sold.  We use the mini pods for our newborn.  The super pods will be MUCH too big for some time.  We use the bamboo during the day and the microfiber at night.  I bought some of each to try, but the microfiber pods are much bulkier and less absorbent (go figure) so for the sake of the diaper fitting under clothes and her not looking like she is all butt, we use the bamboo during the day for a trimmer fit.  They are as easy as disposables to put on and changing the pods are super easy.  I really love these diapers.  The only leak problems we have had are when my husband has failed to tuck the pod completely into the shell, so operator error.  Since we have only used them on a newborn, I can't testify to their performance on a mobile baby.  And with waking up every few hours in the night, I am not sure how the absorbency will go when she is asleep for a whole night, but what I have seen so far has made me very optimistic.I deduct a star because I find their customer service to be really lacking.  I went to their website to purchase a large package with pods, but they were out of the pods forever, despite several promises of \"next week.\"  I got tired of waiting and ordered from Sweet Bottoms Baby for the same price except with free shipping.  I also don't like that they don't have prints except for their \"calendar bums\" and I have not been super impressed with those.  They have older calendar prints available, but they are all very boy leaning.  The only color they have for girls is the pink and it is not the same as it looks online.  It is the color of a hunk of Double Bubble gum- not cute.  You can find pics all over the internet of really cute girl prints, but they have all been discontinued.Overall, a great system to use, but poor customer service from the company and less options for colors and prints for baby girls.

I originally bought 2 trays but because I would make food in large amounts, I went back and bought 2 more. I love the fact that there is a cover. I really don't care how many ounces each slot holds. I just needed something to be able to freeze the food I was making. I make soups, applesauce, puree  fruit like mangos and peaches and use the trays to freeze then put them in ziplock bags for storage. I have made large amounts of soup, like a butternut squash soup and I will have to freeze them in batches. The last time I used 2 squashes and I think it made 16 trays worth of food. These have really been a lifesaver for me. I am not someone who cooks everyday so I was worried about how I would feed my child. He didn't become interested in eating until he was over 8 months old. Once I got the hang of making things in larger batches, I take them out of the freezer, still frozen, the night before and store them in square glass dishes with a plastic top that I bought from Crate and Barrel. So all I have to do is take the top off and microwave it and it is ready to go. For my son's size he eats a lot so being able to freeze food in these sizes has been really helpful. My son can get a variety of foods to eat every day. Highly recommend this product. I also hand wash these.

I can see while having a newborn the light would be awesome because it illuminates the room so you can nurse and change diapers at night without blinding everyone in the room. But for me, my son was about 9 months and didn't need diaper changes at night and i had to go in the room one night and was shocked how bright the room was! the light literally lights up the entire room. And there is no off switch! i started throwing a heavy blanket over it but later worried that something would catch fire because its plugged in and warm. Then I decided to just unplug it right before bed but in the morning didn't like frigid cold wipes when i needed them because i would sometimes forget to replug it in in the morning (plus it takes 30 min to heat all the wipes up). So, now it is in the kitchen and I have to know ahead of time that he has a poop so i can grab two wipes before heading to the changing table.

I took the plunge and I am so glad I did! My son LOVES his rainforest Jumperoo! We tried it for the first time at 6 months but he did not want to stay in for too long without mommy or daddy to cheer him on. He is now almost 9 months and literally makes this cute crying noise each time we walk by the jumperoo because he wants to get in, jump around and explore all the various buttons and animals. The cool thing that I absolutely love about this product is that the chair moves around easily and so my son is never bored as he explores each of the exciting little animals,lights and the music is tons of fun. He recently discovered the little bird and frog that hang above his head and it sooo cute to see him trying to swat them. The only thing I would honestly say is that you have to have a bit of patience when putting this product together especially the seat. It's not very easy but once you have everything in, have a video camera ready as you will want to capture the first moment your little one gets in! I highly recommend this product.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "12 8, 2011", "summary": "Better than sliced bread! love! love! love! This product."}

We introduced him to one of the five figurines at a time, since we knew that he will get eventually bored with them. The figurines are small and fun to hold and look at. They are quality made and have lasted for as long as our interest in them.

My wife got a cover for restaurant high chairs, which can be amazingly sticky, and she brings along Clorox disinfecting wipes for other things within easy reach. This is the flu season, after all, and this year it's the swine flu we're talking about. Well, we try to protect the little guy, but his hands just get all over the table and everything else within reach, and then head straight for his mouth, of course. This past week my wife added a Kiddopotamus Tiny Diner Place Mat to our protective devices. It fits on any strange tables we encounter and it works very well.It works well on the home table as well, but here the emphasis is different. At home it's protection for the table, rather than for the kid. In either case, it fastens down with small suction cups. The little boy can smear stuff all over it and we can easily peel the mat off and give it a washing. Real Handy. It even has a little trough on the table-edge side to catch inevitable spillage in that direction. We chose the blue, but the green would have been just as good. We're going to get a lot of use out of this nifty little accessory.Gary Peterson", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "11 9, 2009", "summary": "A Handy Accessory."}
