It contains some material about aspartame and MSG.  Excitotoxins have been found to dramatically promote cancer growth and metastasis. In fact, one excitotoxin researcher noticed that, when cancer cells were exposed to glutamate, they became more mobile, and you see the same effect with MSG. It also causes a cancer cell to become more mobile, and that enhances metastasis, or spread.

I also always liked my coffee creamed, sweetened, and preferably flavored as mocha, french vanilla, hazelnut, etc. The one exception for me was Guatemalan coffee, which I preferred unflavored with cream and sweetener.That being said, I have tried Ayurvedic, Teeccino (Maya and Mocha), and Roastaroma as coffee substitutes. I had no desire to try Pero or Cafix, since they are designed to mimic straight coffee, which I do not prefer anyway.For a straight coffee substitute, I think Ayurvedic is the best: smooth, dark, and healthful. But a little pricier than the others.Teeccino is very good, but tends to brew with a lot of sediment in the cup and makes for a messy cleanup after brewing.I have settled on Roastaroma because it is cheap, tastes better than any of the others in my opinion, and is mindlessly easy to make.Two bags in a 15 oz. mug and hot water. Steep, throw away the bags, and cream and sweeten to taste. Voil&aacute;! It has a very smooth, cinnamon nutty cocoa taste. Really fine!I don't miss coffee one tiny bit!Thanks, Celestial Seasonings!'Tis da bomb!", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "10 10, 2012", "summary": "If you can't drink coffee, drink roastaroma!"}

After recently having bought a Keurig, I was a bit disappointed at the somewhat watered-down light-bodied taste of most of the K-Cups which came as a sample with it.So my first inclination was to browse the Amazon reviews of several varieties of K-Cup coffee and take advantage of what others who like a nice strong bold cup of coffee had learnt by trial and error - and that was a good move!  I took you all at your word, ordered a 50-pack of this coffee on Monday, had my first cup of it this morning, and decided it was worth submitting my first ever review of any Amazon product ever, both to give it a 5-star rating myself and to thank those of you who take the time & trouble to give honest reviews for the benefit of people like me.So for the record, on a price and quality scale this is my new favourite K-Cup coffee.  Until now, my favourite on a pure quality scale wasStarbucks Caff&egrave; Verona, Dark Roast, 27-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers(excellent but very pricey!) and for a bold-yet-affordable cup wasGreen Mountain Coffee Double Black Diamond, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig Brewers 24-Count(also excellent, and less pricey, but IMO not quite as nice in flavour as Emeril's \"Big Easy Bold\").For anyone looking for a nice strong full-bodied and flavourful K-Cup coffee which won't break the bank, do try this one.

It doesn't compare, however, to sodas that it will probably have more direct competition from such as Sunkist, the numerous Fanta flavors and others.  Why?  Because when most folks want a soda, they want a sugar-laden treat that'll give them a little spark.  This is soda for folks who care a bit more about their health than the average joe.  It's also a good choice for people who may not be able to drink sugar-shockers like Cherry Coke.I'm not saying that Izze Sparkling Juice is bad.  In fact, it tastes pretty good.  It contains seventy percent fruit juice (and most of that is white grape and apple) and thirty percent sparkling water.  The sugars that are contained in this drink are all natural.  It's also got a few vitamins in there, which are a plus.The pomegranate juice has a bit of a tart bite to it, and in my opinion the lemon juice that's also contained in this drink stands out a bit.  The can is 8.4 ounces, so you won't be getting the usual twelve ounces from the average can of soda.  Be sure to drink it very cold, because much like Miller Lite, it's pretty rank when it's warm or just a tad cool.In closing, Izze's got a good thing going with their sparkling juices.  This item will probably fit best in the health niche market, and I don't see it hurting the sales of Sunkist any time soon.

My review will try to supply some background on both rooibos and the product itself, after which I'll provide what I hope are some helpful tips for enjoying and appreciating red espresso.Rooibos (literally \"red bush\" in Afrikaans, pronounced more or less \"ROY'-bawss\") is a shrub that grows in South Africa which tea-deprived Afrikaaners discovered made a not-too-shabby substitute for tea when dried and oxidized. It turned out to have been a fortuitous discovery because research seems to support claims indicating that rooibos contains lots of healthful elements and provides a high level of antioxidants without caffeine. It  has a pleasant, sweetish taste (nothing to which I can compare it--sorry) and though most folks prefer it sweetened (a spot of agave nectar is the perfect complement), with or without a splash of milk, it's quite nice straight up as well. It also blends beautifully with spices and makes a fabulous chai (check out Rishi--they have excellent rooibos-based chai blends).Interestingly enough, red espresso also came into being as the result of desperation. It seems the founder of the company was jonesing for an espresso and, finding the cupboard bare, it occurred to him that perhaps substituting the rooibos he DID have on hand would provide a temporary fix. Lo and behold, his espresso maker produced a deep brew that actually had a crema! Seeds sewn, he began to experiment with different grades of rooibos and then with different cuts in an attempt to develop the best-tasting, most robust rooibos possible--one that would hold up to espresso brewing. Red espresso was born!Red espresso is a much heavier brew than other rooibosses I've tried, even when prepared by drip method (you can use a Chemex or other some such for this). You can also, I imagine, use a French press. However, the best way to prepare it is in a stovetop espresso maker such as a Bialetti Brikka. The last time I checked, red espresso wasn't completely approved for espresso makers but that might have changed by now--it's been two years since I read that. Simply use the same routine used for coffee: fill the tray with red espresso, fill the pot to the correct water level, and heat until you hear the \"pop.\" You're now ready to have fun with your red espresso shot (I've read on coffee sites that the two-cup stovetop makers produce better results than the four-cup models that are most often available here in the States--shop around).The company's Web site has some wonderful recipes and suggestions for red espresso; have a look: [...] (hit the link for \"red drinks\"). It's delicious  (and beautiful) in shakes and smoothies, and there's a really nice recipe that floats red espresso on apple juice, although it tastes better with a natural, \"cloudy\" apple juice than with a clear one. Get creative!I e-mailed the red espresso team two years ago after first trying it (I'd stumbled onto the Web site and asked my friend to bring me some) and they actually called me to chat! When they e-mailed me a few months ago to announce that Amazon would be carrying it, I replied that I suspected it would turn up in Vine, in which case I'd be able to review it and they wrote back that it was indeed slated for Vine and that they were eager for my review. I've been holding my breath ever since, especially since it didn't show up last month. I've been hoping ever since that not only would red espresso take off in a big way internationally (it's apparently very popular in South Africa), but that I'd have easier access to it. With any luck and Amazon's help, fulfillment on both counts is looking good!  :)If you have any interest in brewed beverages and want to experience something that's healthful, delicious, and novel (stovetop espresso makers are fun to use), by all means, give red espresso a \"shot,\" especially if you already have an espresso maker of some sort that doesn't involve pods (feh). You can always try it with the drip method to see if you want to make the small investment required for a stovetop pot.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "05 21, 2009", "summary": "Heerlik!

I'm especially sensitive to the taste of alcohol in extracts, yet don't notice it at all in this vanilla.

That way the vanilla remains full flavored fresh right down to the last bottle. With this type of cap there is no drying mess at the top of the bottle. It is sealed from the air and can even be stored lying on its side. With the boriolli bottles I can easily manage the cap, even with arthritis. I'm not a fan of storing liquid foods in plastic bottles anyway, so I rebottled right after receiving the shipment. Then, to use in an 8oz. bottle I have yet to spill, over a month of regular use.

To heat the entree, you fold back the cover to expose the sauce tray, nuke for one minute, remove the cover, remove the sauce tray and pour the sauce over the pasta.The package claims the meal is 100% natural with no preservatives, and indeed I see no strange chemicals in the list of ingredients.I have deducted one star just because I thought the meat sauce was rather undistinguished (although still far superior to what's in a Chef Boyardee can and better than most frozen pasta entrees I've tasted).  I liked the other two Barilla entrees I tried some months back better -- I think one of them featured a marinara sauce.Still, for a one-minute meal you can keep on hand in a kitchen cupboard or office drawer, this Barilla Gemelli with Meat Sauce hits the spot.UPDATE: I just heard that Barilla's president made some statement about not wanting gay families to appear in his company's ads.

Bigger than any other microwave popcorn I've ever tried.  I felt there was just the right amount of salt to butter ratio.My next test was to empty the bag into a bowl, so I could count the old maids.  It didn't look like very many, but when I counted them, there were 45 old maids.  It still didn't look like that much, so I measured the old maids.  There were 1.5 teaspoons, which is what I would expect for any brand of microwave popcorn.All-in-all, this is a hit at my house.  The delicious flavor and the size of the popped corn makes up for the inconvenience of having to remember to cook it for 15 seconds less than the minimum time and having to cut the bag open (as opposed to tearing it open).  I'll buy this again.Edit: The ingredients are much simpler than any other microwave popcorn I've ever tried.  They are: Whole Grain Popping Corn, Palm Oil, Sea Salt, Butter, Mixed Tocopherols (for freshness), Natural Flavor.  There is a warning that this contains milk (I assume that's the butter).

I was given one as a gift but I like strong coffee and found that even with ex-bold blends and 7oz brews, the result was too weak for my taste and the cost was too high to produce an adequate AMERICAN SIZE cup of coffee (10-12oz) by running the 7oz cycle twice (~$1.20/cup at home) so I came to Amazon to find a better solution.  This was a success with the cost of a double 7oz cup costing ~$0.35 utilizing my favorite Viet Namese dark brew.Keurig machines use a pump to force hot water through a small portion of ground coffee in a filter container which is perhaps the best way to brew.  The filter device must not leak and allow the water to bypass flowing through the coffee.  Remember this if you have any problems in use of these caps and the process should be much easier to understand.Save all those K-cups you use when you first get the machine or the times when you are still just too sleepy to do ANYTHING beyond absolute basics without that 1st cup of wake up.  The original pods have an inner synthetic mesh bag for a filter that MUST be preserved intact. The instructions are very simple and done quickly with a routine.  The cups are best removed from the machine immediately and cleaned while still warm and damp since the process is much quicker at this point.The instructions below are lengthy to communicate all the detail I have found necessary but they are not complex and should not be intmidating.  REMEMBER, GENTLY!!!!!!!1) With the used cup, use your fingers (a knife may help those with arthritis make a starting tear) to gently tear the foil lid from the top in a spiral motion to ensure complete removal from the rim of the cup.  You will quickly get a feel as to what will keep the lid from sealing properly-- small amounts of adhesive on the rim will not hurt but lookout for globs of it or large bumps.2) Rap the inverted K-cup smartly in a saucer (as flat to the surface as possible) once or twice to remove most of the grounds.  The remaining small amount may be washed down the drain safely if you have a septic tank.3) Using the sprayer or faucet and your finger, GENTLY rub the residual grounds from the filter bag.  If you do this roughly, you may puncture the bag or seperate it from the container.  If this happens, the cup is no longer useful.  The bag will now be brown so don't attempt to overclean it.4) Seal your lips around the bottom of the inverted clean cup and puff air through the hole into the base to evert the filter bag similar to the way a muffin rises above the pan.  This forces excess water from the mesh and will help it to dry better and more quickly - if it will not inflate, it is most likely detached or has a hole in it which makes it no longer functional.  Set the cup down on its base in an appropriate out of the way place to dry.  I use a saucer in the cabinet which takes up little space and easily holds all 5 of the daily K-cups.*************5) Taking a dry cup from a previous brew, GENTLY push the bag back into normal shape in the cup with your finger and fill it with the appropriate amount of fresh grounds. You may need to experiment with this a little to get what your taste demands.  If you are just trying to duplicate the K-cup taste, fill it with pre-ground drip grind coffee to about 1/8\" below the rim of the cup.  DO NOT FILL THE CUP TO THE RIM AND DO NOT TAMP!!!!  The coffee soaks up water and needs to expand slightly -- this is the most probable reason for a misbrew, especially when the grounds run out the top of the K-cup.To get a stronger brew, MY PROCESS is (experiment with grinding the beans more finely than drip grind but not ultra fine espresso grind) scoop the coffee from the container with the cup itself then scrape the grounds level with the rim using perhaps the back of a knife.  THEN, tap the base of the cup on the counter to level and slightly settle the coffee to counter the static holding the fine ground apart-- it will wind up about 1/8\" below the rim as stated above.  Do not tamp the coffee in the cup, there are limits to what the small pump in this machine can handle. Remember, this is NOT a $3,000 espresso machine and clogged filters will pass very little brew or force the water out of the lid to a resulting mess.The finer grind allows the coffee to be more compact but still have a greater suface area to increase the solubility of the essential oils.  If you grind the beans too fine or pack them too tightly, they will clog the filter, resulting in a misbrew.6) When the cup is properly filled, wipe the rim clean of all grounds and install the lid.7) HOLDING THE LID ON, turn the cup over to locate the existing hole and rotate the cup so the hole will match the machine pin location (as you face the machine, it is away from you, towards the machine) when inserted.  Turn the cup back upright and GENTLY insert the cup into the machine rotating it until the pin aligns with the hole and the cup drops down flush with the holder.  My first attempts made a second hole but it makes a superior brew with just the one.8) You are ready to brew!9) Remember, it is easier but not mandatory to clean the cups while still warm and damp-- this takes only a few seconds at this time with an established routine.My 94yo Mother lives with us, and every morning I fill 5 cups for a double 7oz brew apiece for us and a single 10oz brew for my Mother (she likes her coffee weak??).  I walk in the kitchen, turn the keurig on and fill the K-cups.  The 5 cups are prepared in the very short time it takes the pre-heat to cycle and within 3 or 3-1/2 minutes total, I have my 14oz morning wakeup for about $0.30 or 20-30% of what it costs to buy 2 K-cups.  AND, it is MY FAVORITE BRAND brewed strong enough to be palatable!The cups will wear out after a while (holes in bag or adhesive failure) so this method depends on continued occasional use of factory K-cups to replenish your supply unless you know others who would save them for you.  I have purchased one of the K-cup replacement modules with metal screen filters but I am still experimenting with that since they are much more expensive and efficiency (in my case) depends on having multiple sets to fill all 5 cups at once and they are too pricey to have 5 just for an experiment.  The metal screens seem to be less fine than the bag filters and will require a different grind to be best.  Those modules seem to be slightly larger than the K-cups so the additional coffee would seem to promise richer brews.  Also, the metal will not absorb the oils as paper and synthetic filters seem to and after all, coffee is an extraction of those oils from the bean-- a major reason Mr Coffee can't produce a really rich cuppa mud.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "10 25, 2011", "summary": "Effective k-cup recycler"}

Some of them have been barely palatable--bland but watery.  Some of them have been decently sweet and tasty.  Some have been simply dreadful to the point that I have had to apologize to my child for trying to make them eat any of it.  I had never before tried the pouched foods like Baby Gourmet, however, so this was a new experience in our household.Ever since the truly dreadful baby food incident, I make a point of tasting all new brands and flavors of baby food that come into our house.  Anything I can't stand doesn't get served to the kids.  So, when I opened the first pouch of Baby Gourmet Organic Simple Purees: Juicy Pear and Garden Greens I tried it out first.  Wasn't quite convinced that pear and garden greens would be a nice meld . . . and the green color didn't quite convince me.  However the taste was  sweet without being overwhelming.  It's obvious there's greenery in the puree, but the bitterness of the greens doesn't come through.  The puree itself is creamy without the kind of textures that bothered my picky eater son when he was a baby.  When I served this up to my daughter, she wolfed it down in no time, quickly eating an entire pouch and wanting more.  Now, my daughter will admittedly eat a wide range of things, but this food is clearly a favorite and she recognizes the pouches now when I get them out.For parents wanting quality store-bought baby food, this is a great option.  If you can't make your own food because of time constraints etc.  This one hundred percent organic babyfood has no added sugar or salt.  It's also gluten free and nut free, which makes it a good match for children with food allergies.  The pouch packaging is BPA free, which adds to the appeal.  These foods can be served hot or cold, and the screw top opening can be reapplied to close the pouch and use it later. If serving it warm, either heat the pouch up in a bowl of warm water, or remove the food from pouch before microwaving.  I do admit the pouches can be a little frustrating to empty: like squeezing out a toothpaste tube really: squeezing the last of the food out can be a bit tricky.  However, these containers pack easily and store well.  If you're not an arts and crafts inspired parent who can find endless uses for baby food containers, these might be easier to dispose of and are excellent for food on the go.  The variety is also fantastic.  I've only tried the one food, but looking over what Amazon has to offer, there are plenty of other flavors to explore.My only real complaint is that this baby food is not inexpensive.  It's well worth the price if you can afford it, but for the regular grocery budget, it's just not viable in our household to buy this as more than an occasional treat or travel option.  If you've the money to splurge and want to find a tasty organic baby food for your little one, I'd definitely recommend this!Happy Eating ^_^ Shanshad", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "03 19, 2012", "summary": "Tasty Product, Good Quality (My daughter agrees)"}

However, the advertising makes it seem like this keeps food hot enough to really cook over a long period of time - kind of like a slow cooker or crock pot,  - but this product is NOT for that.I have tried several recipes now. First, I found that I did not cook something at the beginning long enough so that when I opened the bag four hours later, it was not done and I had to still cook it some more. However, it did shorten the cook time by about 40 minutes.Second, if all your pans have handles on them, the Wonderbag will have a hard time providing a snug fit, and the heat escapes into the surrounding areas of the bag when it is not really tight up to the pot. So if you don't have a pot without a long handle on it, invest in one or more.Next, this Wonderbag is really more useful to cook and transport food and keep it really hot until you arrive at your destination. It is a great way to keep things covered and hot and protected so that you don't burn yourself during the transport.When you are not using this, you will need to find a place to store it. Once you open it up and fluff it out, it is large and takes up a lot of space. I keep mine in the top of a pantry closet. However, I can see that in some countries or some 1st world communities, people would use this every day - I don't.

The chef/instructor explained that in Italy flour is classified as either as type 1, 0, or 00. This scale refers to how finely ground the flour is and how much of the bran and germ have been removed.  The scale has nothing to do with the protein content - that is dependent on the type of wheat. Doppio Zero is the most highly refined - it resembles talcum powder - and is the choice of Italians for making both pizza and pasta.After learning how easy it is to make pasta, I bought a pasta maker the minute got home, and have spent the past year perfecting my skills at making it - it's so fun and easy once you get the knack.  I've been using all-purpose and semolina flours (or a blend of both) to make fresh pasta, and have been very happy with the results, but I decided to splurge on the authentic stuff.  The first batch I made with the 00 flour took me back to that cooking class in Rome and the amazing silken pasta we made that day - the texture is noticeably different.  I've also used the double-zero flour to make pizza dough, and the resulting crust was simply over the top.All-purpose flour is a perfectly acceptable substitute for authentic Italian 00 flour, and it certainly costs a lot less, but if you're ready to take your pizza and pasta making skills to the next level, you owe it to yourself to give it a try.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "02 21, 2012", "summary": "TASTE THE DIFFERENCE  &#127470;&#127481; &#127470;&#127481; &#127470;&#127481;"}

This assortment is the sweet stuff and they are all really good.  Thanks to the Kernel Season's product line, we have really come up with a great system for making great popcorn.  We start with theKernel Season's Movie Theatre Butter for Popping & Topping Popcornfor a popping oil (we never use this for a topping, too oily).  2 or 3 tablespoons with about 1/3 a cup of popcorn gives the popcorn an excellent subtle buttery tasting base for the seasonings to stick to.  We pop all our popcorn in the greatest popcorn device ever, theWabash Valley Farms Whirley-Pop Stovetop Popcorn Popper.  We also likeAmish Country Popcorn Mushroom Popcornwhich pops up big and fluffy.  After the popcorn is popped and cools for a few seconds we dump it into a clean plastic grocery bag and shake in about 3 or 4 teaspoons of our favorite dry seasoning (more or less to taste) and shake it up well.  Believe me, this is a great bowl of popcorn.  The seasonings don't work too well with hot air poppers because they need something to stick to.This selection of dry seasoning is the sweet pack.  The Kettle Corn, used in the right measure (not too much! Subtlety is the key!) is almost indistinguishable from the real thing.  The Caramel flavoring is understated, but really good.  Unlike the Kettle Corn, the Caramel flavoring doesn't taste too much like actual caramel corn but getting real caramel corn is a completely different process than most people want to partake in when preparing a simple bowl of popcorn.  This gives you a nicely sweetened popcorn with a taste of Caramel that is not too overbearing, different than normal caramel corn but still good.The Chocolate Caramel flavor we put off to the last because we really enjoyed the other flavors and this one just didn't seem that appealing. Chocolate? I am happy to say that when we actually tried it we were very pleased to find out that it was our favorite of the three.  Again, don't go crazy, just go for a subtle taste and I believe you will really enjoy the awesome taste of all these flavors, especially the Chocolate Caramel.It has been a couple of months since we have started using the Kernel Season's Seasonings and I can't imagine making a bowl of popcorn where I am not experimenting with one of them.  I believe the trick is not to go too heavy with the flavoring; don't overwhelm the popcorn and have an good buttery tasting popping oil base.  Experiment a little with how much you use, make sure you mix the flavorings in well and I think you will be pleased with the result.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "05 14, 2014", "summary": "The Sweet Assortment!"}

Ronzoni is made locally so it was always available at a good price and my mother - the best cook in the world - bought their products and made \"macaroni a couple times a week. Recently, Cooks Magazine did a show on public TV and mentioned that Ronzoni's spaghetti had always scored their highest numbers for taste and texture. Go figure! But this show included Barilla and they said that this made-in-Italy pasta nudged out the former king of the hill, Ronzoni. Naturally, I had to get a box and test it and, to my minor surprise, the taste, texture and ability to stand up to a strong sauce (home made - chopped San Marzano tomatoes, onions, garlic, olive oil, a touch of aged Balsamic, a few red chili flakes and a tiny bit of sugar) was quite close to tried and true Ronzoni. Is it better? Well, Cooks thought so and they seem to be a lot more respected than I but having enjoyed Ronzoni for (gulp) decades, it's hard for me to say that Barilla really bested them. I would say it was a close contest and Barilla can hold its head high.A few thoughts - make sure that you do not over cook this or any spaghetti. It cooks quickly because it's so thin and goes from good to glue when you boil too long. Also, and this is key, salt the water. Yeah, I know SALT!!! Tell your doctor to forget it. The only reason people who watch everything they eat live longer is because they are so miserable that it only seems that they live longer!Salt - it makes all the difference in the world - just don't over do it.4 Stars and maybe 4 1/2 considering it took on the champ.

So, I was looking forward to trying this. Having tried it, I can say that I would not ever purchase this.I tried it hot first, following the instructions (then putting half in the fridge to cool). First, it doesn't look at all like the picture on the outside of the foil packet. Instead of a lovely golden yellow, it is the light brown of a beef or vegetable broth. Hoping that wasn't a harbinger of things to come, I sat down to enjoy the flavor. Unfortunately, I didn't really enjoy it. There was VERY little lemon flavor - more like a slight lemon aftertaste, and only if you're really looking for it. The overall flavor is much more bitter than fresh ginger would be, with an almost medicinal taste. The ginger bite is there, and is about the only thing that really reminds me of what ginger should be.Then I tried it cold (with an ice cube to help cool it down). The flavor didn't seem as strong, but it still had the bitter taste. After those first few sips of both hot and cold, I honestly couldn't drink any more of this. The aftertaste was too much and I genuinely did not want to finish the drink. So - I didn't.Overall, if you're used to something like Stash Ginger Honey tea, or even tea made from fresh ginger, then this is no substitute. The flavor profile is very different, and the bitterness is hard to get past. If you have the opportunity to try a smaller amount before purchasing this, then I would highly recommend you do so.

I used one of the entire 3-ounce packages with 128 ounces of water after bringing the water to 180 degrees in the microwave (I like to make tea in quantity). After expanding, the package of pearls fits perfectly in aNew Twist-Lock Spice Ball Tea Infuser Herb Infuser, Stainless Steel, Extra Large Size (4 x 3.5\"). I was able to make another 64 ounces of tea reusing the peals but it was half as strong and not as good. Now, Rishi Jasmine Pearl is 5 to 10 times more expensive than tea bags (costing $.50 to $.75 a cup) but it's a completely different flavor and so can't be compared.I know I will likely offend the purests here with what I did next - I added three individual packets ofCrystal Light On The Go Natural Lemonade, 10 Count Packets (Pack of 6)(enough for 48 ounces in the 128 ounces of water). But, the acid (I assume) wholly changed the flavor of this tea (much greater effect than I've found with any other tea). I'm not surprised that a Google search shows green tea lemonade is a fairly popular recipe. This combination is now a favorite drink. My next experiment will have to be with a couple of cups of fresh squeezed lemon juice.I'm trying green tea because L-theanine (the amino acid providing the unique flavor of the tea) has been shown to boost one's immune system as well as to reduce mental and physical stress (in other words, untwisting twisted thinking ... this was my primary goal as I often get mentally jumbled with to-do lists, etc). L-theanine is supposed to be helpful for concentration (improving cognition and mood purportedly in a synergistic manner with caffeine) and relaxation. Thus, L-theanine can be found both in many nighttime sleep aids (without, of course, the caffeine) as well as daytime power drinks.UPDATE: Don't make a large quantity - the tea becomes very bitter, even undrinkable, after a couple of days.2nd UPDATE: S.L. mentioned the contamination issue. Salmonella is a problem with eggs, hamburger, etc. However, I understand tea that has been sitting at room temperature for any length of time (such as Sun Tea or by adding new tea to a used pitcher as is commonly done at resturants) is a notorious source instead of the coliform bacteria (I believe salmonella is more about handling issues - for example, four years ago a Arizona tea vendor made 14 people sick with improper washing). Thus, one should never keep brewed tea for more than eight hours at room temperature (\"Sun\" tea is better made in the frig over night). Even refrigerated fresh tea will last only 2-3 days... and fresh lemon juice has the same limited shelf life. Don't drink if the tea appears darker. Many restaurants \"solve\" these problems by switching to instant tea and \"garbage\" sweeteners (which in no way defeat the positive effects of Green Tea's L-theanine) as they will remain good to drink much much longer. Fresh tea leaves also often themselves become contaminated with coliform bacteria. I assume this is why bagged teas brew tea that lasts days longer as well as the point for the serious packaging used in this product (I've also found store bought mango and orange juice used for sweetening last much longer than fresh as well). Again thusly, making large quantities of tea to use for more than a few days afterward wholly defeat the purpose of a healthy drink - even worse than coffee or root beer (banned for its ill effects)... ha ha.I now use half of a 3-ounce Rishi Tea package in a 51 ounce bottle of Highland Spring Water (crisp and not mineralized water is key to good tea as chlorinated, deoxygenated, and hard tap water will produce negative interactions) to \"brew\" several days in the frig. I then add three 17-ounce bottles of Orange Mango Sparkling ICE Spring Water (which already contains a small amount of green tea) and the juice from a couple lemons (I still find the fruit acid very important to a far better flavor).", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "04 4, 2011", "summary": "Tastes great but costs much more"}

The sauce is sickly sweet and has a tang of too much acidity for my liking. The noodles, though, are surprisingly good and the texture of the bits of meat add just enough to the meal to make it better. The meat itself, like most of the Hormel line, doesn't really have much of a taste of it's own but without it the spaghetti would fall much flatter. This would be definitely a five star for me if only the sauce was a bit more robust in flavor with less of the overwhelming sweetness. The other pasta dishes of the line can be doctored up easily by adding some hot sauce to mask the sweetness but for some reason I'm not a fan of spicy spaghetti so I can't bring myself to do it :)For what this is -- a non-perishable prepared food that is fairly cheap -- it's pretty good.

There are times when I'm quasi-hungry, i.e. craving something that's not junk but nothing that can qualify as a meal either. Popcorn is a good choice; the problem is that I'm no fan of salt, even though I like butter. I've been searching for a quality shake-cheese (no, I'm not a New Englander), preferably cheddar, but there's nothing available here in brick-and-mortar establishments.Enter Kernel Season's White Cheddar Seasoning.This stuff is just what I needed and one need not limit it to popcorn! Since I always add melted butter to my popcorn, no problem with Kernel Season's sticking and in my experience, one need not add copious amounts in order to get the benefit of a natural cheesy taste (your own mileage may vary). Another reason I like having it on hand is to add cheesy goodness to things to which I'd normally add cheese I grate when needed. Don't get me wrong--Kernel Season's is no substitute for that Fontina Val d'Aosta you've been using up by adding it to tomato soup but it certainly does in a pinch and adds a nice depth to soups, salad dressings, and such. There are times I don't have cheese on hand and it's nice to know I can fall back on Kernel Season's.It's evident that a lot of care when into the development of Kernel Season's, including its presentation. The 2.85 oz. shakers can easily be tucked away to be enjoyed away from home, e.g. at picnics or even at the movies (don't let the users catch you). As long as it's kept cool, it doesn't need to be refrigerated, it's certified gluten-free, and it's even kosher! (Although things are improving of late, it hasn't been my experience that there's much good going on in the way of kosher cheese, which makes Kernel Season's even more of a standout.) I'm extremely fussy about what I ingest and on that note, I'm very pleased to be able to recommend Kernel Season's.

It's also no healthier than regular soda pop: Although they can claim \"no sugar added\", the claim of \"full serving and fruit and vegetables\" is extremely misleading because a serving of either typically consists of a large amount of fiber and a small amount of protein, and in this drink everything but the sugar has been removed has been removed. Real stuff also has higher vitamin and mineral content. I'd consider that false advertising, since having this will only make you crave more, not feel full.

Those who have not read it will vote it down. Yes, reading is required to know why I recommend these, as well as things to watch out for.The reason I purchased chia seeds is because I wanted to start eating all natural foods that are thought to help fight or prevent cancer, and chia seeds were in a list of foods I got from several websites (also flax seed, but men should not eat flax because it can enlarge the prostate). So, I chose chia seeds because I wanted a food supplement that my husband could also eat.FAST/FREE SHIPPING & LOW PRICE, BUT:I ordered them on the 22nd and they arrived on Saturday the 26th - sold and fulfilled by Amazon via the subscribe and save offer ($19.95 with FREE shipping and a discount applied for subscribe and save came to about $16 and change for the bag, can't beat that). Keep in mind you can adjust or end subscribe and save items very easily so I highly recommend it with any item you order that offers subscribe and save. BUT if the price gets above $23 I'll look for it elsewhere. Getting tired of finding a good item at a fair price just to have the price hike up when I'm ready to reorder or after I or someone else gives it a good review. Greedy sellers, beware. We consumers are on to you and will not tolerate your greed much longer!!GOOD PACKAGING, BUT:When food is involved I get very picky about packaging. My first requirement is that it is in a container that prevents contamination. It came in a box with a bag that was shrink wrapped against a piece of cardboard so it would not shift around in route. The bag of seeds is clearly vacuum sealed very tight. My only complaint is that it is in a plastic bag (I believe all plastics are toxic) but you must consider the only way to ship this stuff air tight would be in plastic or glass, and you know it won't be shipped in glass. So I did not take away any stars for the plastic. I transferred the entire bag to an air tight glass jar with a metal screw on top then I keep a small shaker top bottle (spice jar) filled with it for easy use.Note: it's important to keep in mind that when you break the air seal of an item like this (any vacuum sealed package) you're basically starting the degradation countdown. Meaning, it's stated that they can last longer than 2 years and they most likely mean if you do not break the air-tight seal. I have chosen to break the seal so I can get rid of the plastic, and in doing this know they will only last the stated 2 years or less. But I expect to have eaten them all within about a year. I mention this for those of you who might also not want to keep the seeds in plastic.CLEARLY LABELED - INCLUDING PACKED ON & BEST BY DATES:Another thing that's important to me when buying food (especially by mail) is clear labeling with all the info I need about the item. There is a nutrient values label with the company address, website, and toll free phone number, stated USDA Organic, and storage instructions. There is also a packed on date, best by date label. The nutrition label also stated can keep for 2 or MORE years, which is helpful to note just in case the dated label was removed. Here's the nutrition facts as per the label with my comments in parenthesis:> Serving Size - 1 tbsp = 12g, 113 per container (that's about .15 cents per 1 tbsp serving, not bad)> Calories - 60 (that all natural organic raw high fiber calories, those are the good calories you want)> Calories from Fat - 25 (as per above)> Total Fat - 3g> Saturated Fat - 0g (perfect)> Trans Fat - 0g (perfect)> Cholesterol - 0g (perfect again)> Sodium - 0g (excellent)> Potassium 60mg (equal to a couple bites of a banana, not bad)> Carbs - 5g (good carbs, with fiber)> Sugars - 0g> Protein - 3g> Calcium - 8% RDA> Iron - 6% RDA> Magnesium - 10% RDAAgain, the reason I'm eating chia seeds is because numerous reputable websites stated they are believed to help prevent and fight cancer. Of course there is no proof of that, but if it has other great properties, is cheap, healthy and doesn't taste bad then why not?MORE THAN I PAID FOR:The bag is supposed to be 3 pounds. I always weight pre-packaged items that are sold by the pound to make sure I'm not getting ripped off. The bag weighed nearly 3.5 pounds (3.436 lbs to be exact). That's nearly 15% extra for free (nearly $2.40 worth of seeds for free). Considering the price was the lowest I've found anywhere (locally or on the internet) I call that a great plus.USES:I really can't taste them. I've put a small pinch in my mouth to taste on their own and detect a light nutty flavor, but they are so small it's hard to taste anything. But I didn't buy them to eat straight. I bought them knowing I'd add them to other foods, like an herb or seasoning. They actually look like coarse fresh ground pepper when sprinkled on food. These are the foods I've used them with (see below), and I can tell you they did not change the flavor of any food unless I added huge amounts. Remember, 1 tbsp is one serving. So, for example if you mix it in a burger or a couple scrambled eggs, all you need is 1 tbsp and that's not enough to change the taste.MIX SEEDS INTO:meat loaf, meat balls, hamburger, tofu mixes, bread dough, cookie dough, muffins or cupcakes, pancake or waffle batter, scrambled eggs, omelets, poultry/mushroom/clam stuffing, mashed potatoes, salad dressing, any kind of dip, soups, sauces, ketchup, mustard, mayo, juices, slushies, ice-cream, home made sherbert, and just about anything that can be \"mixed\" or stirred.orSPRINKLE SEEDS ONTO:salads, vegetables, cereals, ice-cream, dessert icing, fruit cups, or sprinkle on just about any food.I've tried these seeds in all of the above ways over the last 5 months and I either didn't taste them or the flavor was a little nutty, enhancing what I was eating. So, as long as the price is right I will continue to buy and eat these chia seeds, with just about every meal or food item.Happy life and good health to you all!", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "03 26, 2011", "summary": "Versatile, Raw, Organic, Fiber, Protien, Healthy.

A high-quality product featuring and blend of creativity and charitable good sense, it's also a lot of fun! This is a thick, chunky, intense peanut butter--not the ultra-creamy, whipped peanut butter you are used to consuming. There's a whole lot of flavor action going on with this product--which makes it perfect to eat by the spoonful or to use in recipes. I eat peanut butter by the spoonful just about every day--hey, it's my own jar--and one big spoonful of PB CRAVE really hits the spot. I also tried it on graham crackers and made some awesome no-bake \"school house cookies\"--the kind with oatmeal. PB CRAVE would also make a terrific dessert sauce for ice cream or cake, and it would be fabulous on pancakes, waffles, and french toast. I would recommend carefully warming some PB CRAVE in the microwave and then blending in some room-temperature milk, chocolate syrup, honey, maple syrup or corn syrup to make your sauce. As always, when serving food prepared with peanuts or peanut butter, make sure to advise everyone in case someone has a peanut allergy. The flavor that I tried was \"Razzle Dazzle\"--peanut butter with Wild Honey, Dark Chocolate, White Coco Butter Drops, and Natural Raspberry Flavor. As I said before, it's intense! The other flavors are \"CoCo Bananas\", \"Choco Choco\", and \"Cookie Nookie\". PB CRAVE does come in variety packs, and I would love to try all the flavors! According to the company, PB Crave is a natural, premium peanut butter made with US Grown Peanuts. Now, here's where the charitable good sense comes into play, according to the PB CRAVE website, \"A minimum of 2% of the profits from every jar of PB Crave peanut butter goes directly to \"Project Peanut Butter\", a non-profit organization focused on treating malnourished children\". If you're a \"spooner\", like me, being aware of the good works behind the good food makes every bite a little bit better.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "02 3, 2013", "summary": "high-quality product features creative flavors and charitable good sense"}

Each kernel would be perfectly coated and it would taste exactly as it is announced to be.  For a confessed cheese pop corn addict, I have done all I could to find the perfect product. I have purchased everywhere I see a tempting bag. Regretfully, it is rare and hard to come by, when you find a superior Cheddar flavor. That does not mean I stop trying, but pretty soon I know that some bags just don't cut it.  The competition is not as fierce, as let's say, potato chips or tortillas, where you walk down the aisle and several manufacturers are competing for the hard earned dollar.Loyalty has its rewards. Some products are much better than others, and after a while the choices become much more simpler when one knows which is which that taste the best. As tedious as it is to restore the teeth back to normal after eating pop corn, it's just the one bag that calls my attention the loudest.Enter Orville Redenbacher Ready to Eat Popcorn, Sharp White Cheddar, 1.5-Ounce Each. When amazon was nice enough to send me one solitary bag, for a moment there, I was under the impression that I would have to pop it in the microwave. Soon enough I realized that this product, new to me, came from the big honcho pop corn maker. Never before knew they sell the pop corn already popped. I immediately open the bag and in no time it was gone. This is my take: the pop corn was, indeed, large, but at the bottom of the bag there was the customary little bits and pieces, which I basically do not like for now they are like tiny crumbs. The flavor of the pop corn was tasty, but lacking perhaps the sharpness I expected from the bag's description. Decent, but not spectacular. The amount in each bag is enough to get one's fix, as opposed to the larger bags, which I have a lot trouble sharing them and keeping some for next day. Basically they get consumed while watching a show on TV. I guess what I am saying is this: they are so easy to eat!I thought this product was a little better than average, it would definitely be a contender if I saw it in its large version in the aisle of snacks. I have had more cheesy than this one, but one can tell right away that Orville knows how to do pop corn. Brush, floss, whatever it takes to remove up to the last particle once done.

In today's market, there are a lot of super-premium chocolate products available, many of which have a high cacao percentage or are sourced from premium organic cacao pods.  Once you start eating these high-end (milk) chocolates with the higher cacao content, many of the mass produced milk chocolate products start to pale in comparison.  Do some research and you will find that many lower end milk chocolate products are made with vegetable oil or other shortcuts to cut costs.  I am not saying that the Werther's products are low-end, but to me they lack that \"true\" chocolate depth...and it is probably because I am used to these higher cacao content bars now.  Also, the caramel flavor is also not as pronounced as I would have expected.As a good comparison test, go out and buy aGreen & Black's Organic Milk Chocolate Caramel Barand compare/contrast.Bottom line - these are not that bad, but there are better alternatives out there.

I was beginning to think the guys must be almost DEAD.  Waited another 24 hours, not much going on in there so I poured everything through a plastic strainer and put together another batch of water and sugar and added the grains.  Moved this batch to my Master Bath (68 degrees), where it is a lot warmer than my kitchen (62 degrees).  I sat the jar on a dressing table in front of a sunny window, wrapped a towel around it and walked way for 48 hours!  After 48 hours I went to check and OMG I not only had bubbling Kefir water but now had what looked like 1/2 a cup or more of Kefir grains in the bottom of the jar!  WOW.I have now done about 5 batches of Kefir water and have what is probably 1/2 a 3L glass container full of Kefir grains sitting in my refrigerator in my basement to give them a rest from all that activity.

I used to buy Ginger tea bags, but recently switched to Ginger tea \"concintrate\" that appears to be ginger jam, which you add to hot water. Its not very economical, and of course, you cant pack it for lunch, or take it from the house. (cos it comes in a glass jar you keep in the fridge.) GOLD KILI ginger tea, solves those problems of cost and portability. The 2oz aluminum bag contains freeze dried ginger lemon tea. However, add the WHOLE bag to a cup of tea, and you'll be overwhelmed. One of those 2oz bags, makes a small teapot of hot tea. Short of using fresh ginger, slicing it and boiling it, this tea is the best. The lemon overtone is mild, conplimenting the ginger, not clouding it. For a sore throat, take this concintrate, add it to pure honey, and take by the teaspoon every hour. Also, for fast ginger stir fry, use a packet of this Ginger honey tea, add it to your stir fried veggies and tofu, along with some soy sauce, and you have a good chinese stir fry sauce. Ginger is good for nausea when traveling. If you carry a pouch of this freeze dried tea in your wallet or purse during cold season, you can treat the first signs of flu, ie the nausea, sore throat, or stuffy nose, as soon as it starts. For a stuffy nose, this is good tea, when mixed with some peppermint tea. (Or, try using a peppermint candy cane, as a hot tea swizzel stick.)

I love that brand's melon soda and always look forward to drinking it whenever I'm able to visit Japan, but it's pretty much impossible to find that particular flavor in the states, unless you happen to order it from an auction website, which would be pretty silly, since it doesn't make sense to actually buy something like that online that's obviously being sold over-priced for what it is.As a previous reviewer noted, the flavor of this is pretty light and is not strong (even after properly stirring), so according to your preference, you may have to use just a little extra than what is recommended.  Although I have to admit that this does not taste anything like Fanta's melon soda, it is in my opinion, the closest thing that I could find (that you could make on your own with the addition of sparkling water), and the good thing about these syrups is that you can control how sweet it's going to be, versus buying a can/bottle of soda at the store which has way too much sugar and/or HFCS in it.  Mixing this with sparkling water gives just a faint green color, nothing like that intense green you'll get with Fanta's melon soda, which in retrospect may also be a good thing, since it means that there's not too much (or according to the ingredients list, any) artificial coloring used for this syrup.Taste-wise, I felt that the flavor of the syrup does taste as similar as can be to (and remind me of) melon, and I personally didn't think it tasted bad or that it left a weird/unpleasant aftertaste at all, but then again, everyone's taste perceptions are different and as the saying goes, you can't please everyone.  I am ultimately satisfied with this product and will happily keep using it whenever I happen to have some sparkling water on hand and feel like drinking and making my own melon flavored soda.  Also looking forward to incorporating this with some alcoholic beverages, such as with Flor de Ca&ntilde;a.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "08 12, 2013", "summary": "Closest thing to use for your own melon flavored soda"}

I saw no reason to change it except to mention that I found the Mocha flavor to be even better. It's not nearly as chocolaty or sweet as hot chocolate (thankfully) and it has only 20 calories per cup. It tastes more like coffee then the vanilla and mint and is the flavor smoother. My wife didn't care for the other two but loves the Mocha. It makes for a great, healthy after-dinner desert drink.*This is my second time trying Teeccino and I must say the more I drink it the better I like it. As I've gotten older, coffee is having adverse effects my digestive track and it's not been good so I need something else and tea just doesn't cut it. Teeccino seems to be about as close to coffee as one can get without being coffee. The mint was really good and this vanilla nut may even be better. Teeccino doesn't leave that bad aftertaste coffee gives you (even the really good stuff) and it seems to give a slight energy boost. Nothing like coffee though. No brain stimulation. I think the energy comes from the inulin. I did some research on inulin and I suggest you do the same. I'm still not sure if it's a good thing or not. Some say yes and others no. It doesn't seem to have a negative effect on me as of yet. If you need to get off of coffee or hot chocolate or your just tired of drinking tea give Teeccino a try. I think you'll be quite pleased. Oh yea... I put honey and milk in mine and it's really good that way.I've been making a pitcher at the beginning of the week and keeping it in the fridge. It seems to keep very well.

It does have a tangerine taste to it, though it's accompanied by other flavors.  It's clearly much more natural than regular soda or those 10% juice drinks since it's just fruit juice concentrates and carbonated water vs. the typical high fructose corn syrup plus artificial flavors, colors and preservatives in something like Sunkist.  I think the juice blend is appropriate for this type of beverage.  It does contain more apple and grape than tangerine or orange, but those first two juices complement the carbonation well viz a viz sparkling cider.  I think straight carbonated orange/tangerine juice would probably be a bit much.  The Switch reminds me of Appletiser, which is one of my favorites and has been around for many years, but is still pretty hard to find in the US.That having been said, I had to dock one star for a couple of reasons.  First, the cans just seem too small.  If they're sticking with aluminum cans, I'd like to see the standard 12oz size offered.  It seems like that would also have the advantage of making it easier to offer in regular beverage vending machines.  Alternately, 16 or 20oz bottles would also work.  The second issue is the price.  While I understand there's a huge difference between the cost of real juice and artificially flavored corn syrup, the current price still seems high, even in comparison to other juice drinks.  That might be partly because it's from a relatively small company that doesn't yet have the giant economies of scale that the likes of Coke and Pepsi can take advantage of, but it still seems like the price could come down a bit (or at least serving size could increase without a price increase) and it could perhaps still be made back up in increased sales volume.I pick up Appletiser when I can find it, and I'll likely do the same with The Switch, at least from time to time.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "06 30, 2009", "summary": "Very good, could be a bit better."}

The peach flavor is very natural and in just the right amount.I once passed up this delicious brew in favor of green tea's antioxidant properties until I discovered that black tea has its own equally impressive health benefits. Recent studies have concluded that regular consumption of black tea improves blood vessel function and significantly reduces the risk of stroke, heart attacks and heart disease (by fifty percent), and can help fight cancer and manage diabetes. This is because:*Black Tea contains flavonoids that help to lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL) or 'bad' cholesterol that can lead to strokes and heart attacks.*Black Tea contains the antioxidant polyphenols theaflavins and thearubigins, which have significant cardiovascular benefits.*Black Tea contains a chemical compound known as TF-2 that can help prevent breast and stomach cancer by killing cancer cells through a process described as \"apoptosis programmed cell death\".*Black tea contains high levels of glucose inhibiting polysaccharides that are helpful in managing diabetes.Studies have also found that black tea drinkers have less cavities and plaque accumulation on their teeth because chemical components in black tea called tea polyphenols suppress the growth of cavity-causing bacteria and prevent the formation of the matrix material by which dental plaque adheres to tooth surfaces.So, needless to say, I now regularly drink and enjoy my Stash Peach Black Tea and feel really good about doing so!I use 6 bags to brew a 12 cup automatic coffee pot full of this tea. I sweeten it with stevia packets and it tastes wonderful hot or cold.NOTE: The health benefits of black tea mentioned above are the results of a 15 year study by Netherlands National Institute of Public Health and the Environment, a four month study by Dr. Joseph A.

For lab analysis of pollen in honey refer to the link provided in the comment section.DANDELION: I consume dandelion all the time since it is a superfood to me and I have to travel all the way to a store every single time to purchase few bunch of those beauties since it is a rare green not sold in most US counties. One cup of raw dandelion offers me 112% vitamin A and 535% vitamin K, shocking amount of health in raw stage, a competition to kale but not popular due to its bitter taste. In some of the trails that I hike and mountain bike, there are huge branches of dandelions and luckily most people are not familiar with dandelion so I end up with happy, healthy, wild greens when working out in the mountains but that happens only spring time since when rains stop and heat moves in, dandelions dry out till next season of rain. Healthy, healthy, healthy food. Dandelion is a weed which originated from Asia, China/India centuries ago. It is a superfood since as a green vegetable it is loaded with unbelievable amount of vitamins. Dandelion grows in many gardens as well as grass, a beneficial weed for gardens and nature, its taproot bring up nutrients for shallower-rooting plants, add minerals and nitrogen to soil and release ethylene gas which helps fruit to ripen. Dandelion attracts pollinating insects, especially for northern hemisphere bees, providing an important source of nectar and pollen early in the season. In Europe especially Germany, dandelion is used in herbal medicine to treat infections, bile and liver problems.REAL HONEY: Raw honey is expensive. USDA organic honey is more expensive than just even organic honey without the stamp of USDA. To combine RAW and USDA organic and add qualities like Only 100% pure raw, unpasteurized, unfiltered, undiluted, untreated, unprocessed, no HFCS, not adulterate, not blended with other items such as corn syrup and rice syrup, makes it the true honey not glucose tasting like honey. For that reason that superior product, that superior superfood never sells in big buckets, or hardly ever in any container over 16 oz jar.FILTERING: At country's top honey packers, Dutch Gold, in Lancaster, PA, raw honey gets pumped through layers of white filters. Before the honey hit the filters, a powdered sedimentary rock called diatomaceous earth is added. This is a standard, widely used process. It removes all the pollen, along with dust, bees' wings, and, of course, the diatomaceous earth.ORGANIC HONEY: Organic honey doesn't go through nearly as fine a filter since organic rules prohibit the use of diatomaceous earth in the filtering process but regardless it is not a raw honey just because organic.VARIETY: Weather, location, flower type and season impact the coloring, taste and viscosity of honey produced by bees. Honey by the cost will hardly even crystallize. Tupelo sold by YS is raw although runny and pourable which will not crystallize due to its high moisture content. If from outside of US then Fair Trade stamp has some assurances of fair treatment of workers although not true in every case.CHINESE HONEY: Chinese honey famous for \"ultrapurified,\" a technique that can involve diluting honey with extra water, running it through extremely fine filters, and then removing the water. The process filters out much more and produces a sweet substance that is no longer honey. The process removes any pollens and the possibility of identifying the source of honey. Chinese honey is barred from the U.S. not because it's unsafe, but because U.S. officials decided it was too cheap. Chinese honey has had more than its share of safety problems. But there's also plenty of perfectly good Chinese honey for sale on the world market. EU is fussier about honey quality than the US, yet EU imports lots of honey from China but not US.QUALITY: A honey is only as good as the producer and regardless of all marketing and claims by sellers, there is no assurance that a jar of honey is full of pollen, unheated or unfiltered at 100 degree instead of 130 degree. Even if the honey was heated only to 90 degree at the time of production, the honey jar could be sitting in a storage or while being transported in containers that the temperatures can easily exceed 100 degrees. The only assurance that I have is purchasing honey from a producer with high quality reputation and a seller with high turnover. Wedderspoon brand and New Zealand are on top of my list. Purchasing Wedderspoon directly from Wedderspoon or authorized distributor is the only assurance I have for proper storage, pollen and enzymes that honey is consumed for.USES: I consume honey not by labeling but by the amount of pollen it carries. Only 100% pure raw, unpasteurized, unfiltered, undiluted, untreated, unprocessed, no HFCS, not adulterate, not blended with other items such as corn syrup and rice syrup from only trusted brands. I consume honey all the time since it has many nutritional benefits for me. I consume after any meal since it helps digestion. I used to consume chocolate years ago but I do not anymore since I consume pure cocoa which I add to my power drinks. I am into many sports and quality honey is the best quick energy I can get to boost my immune system and give myself a healthy rush of energy when I am in middle of my mountain biking, hiking, backpacking, surfing, etc. I drink lots of tea and I never use honey instead I use molasses. Molasses does not lose its nutritional value when heated but any heat to raw honey kills the quality enzymes and pollen in honey so I only consume honey straight out of the jar with spoon in moderation due to its high calories. Honey is the best ointment for all my scabs in mountain biking trails. After a day when my wounds are sealed I place raw honey for rejuvenation and it is the best healer of all instead of using Neosporin which loosens the scab and removes the scab, leaving scars on my skin.

The four granola ('plain', banana-nut, cranberry-nut vanilla, blueberry) are pretty tasty in and of themselves - I was surprised by the bits of coconut that was in them, and the little hint of spice was a very nice touch. They're not as 'simple' as some other granola blends I've bought in the past, but that doesn't mean they're not relatively healthy/composed of a lot of crap fillers. Also, it's a nice grouping of different flavors, sure to please a wide range of palates.The bonus to this was the oatmeal and the pancake/waffle mix. Each one is a bit more than just the usual mixes you find out there on the market, and also come with a bit less of that 'crap filler'. They're also rather tasty as well.  All in all, there hasn't been any of this sampler pack that was a disappointment, and the small bags are nice in that it's easy to keep stuff on hand and not worry about anything going bad.

As a hot tea, the flavor was alright, but it was like there were too many herbs and not enough berries.  I did end up needing a bit of sweetener, as I felt the flavor was too earthy.  The vanilla was too subtle to detect.It was when I tried this tea iced that I found I really enjoyed it.  The cold seems to suit the berry flavors nicely, I can taste the vanilla, and I didn't need any sweetener at all.I have never cared for Lipton's pyramid tea bag packaging.  There is nothing protecting the tea bags inside of the box, such as a paper liner, and since the pyramid shaped tea bags are too awkward to be individually wrapped, it's just open tea bags sitting together in a paperboard box.

Maybe because I'm a full leaf tea drinker I've gotten accustomed to a different chai taste.  This has a mild to medium spice to it, about a 4 on a scale of 1 - 10 (I also like a heavy spice in my chai but most people don't so I'm not holding the level of spice against it), but the spices don't fully taste like what the REAL spices should taste like.  At first it kinda does but then you realize it is not real.  Like comparing REAL vanilla extract to imitation.Then, to add to the chemical spice taste, it has artificial sweetener added.  Ok, I drink Coke zero, so it is not like I'm totally against fake sugars.  But this thing has a fake sweetener taste that REALLY lingers on my tongue.  And it is almost too sweet.  I usually put 2 - 3 teaspoons to a 8-10 oz mug of tea when I brew it full leaf.  So I do like my stuff sweet.  But this is almost an overpowering sweet taste.In all, there was nothing really redeeming about it.  I tried mixing one K-cup with some instant chai latte I picked up at the grocery store (which used real sugar and had no hydrogenated stuff in it, but barely had any chai spice flavor to it) but it didn't help.  The weird chemical tastes still overpowered.  Just not worth the time or money for me.Edited to add:I want to add that I'm not opposed to flavored products (either artificially or naturally flavored).  I pretty much only drink flavored coffees, and most of the teas available from places like the zillion dollar an ounce whole leaf tea places like the one whose name melds the words \"Tea\" and \"Nirvana\"  (which I shamefully admit to shopping at) are naturally/artificially flavored. So I wasn't being fussy about the flavor because they added artificial flavors in the ingredients and I was expecting something all natural.Side note on differences between artificial and natural flavors in ingredients: When something says naturally flavored in the ingredients or the side of the box, it just means the chemical they use has a real \"counterpart\" in nature, whereas an artificial flavor will not. So a flavor like blue raspberry will always be labelled artificially flavored, while a flavor like raspberry might say naturally flavored.  But, they both are flavored via lab produced chemicals. So as far as I'm concerned natural flavors are still an artificial product (unless actual oils are used, like Earl Grey Tea using bergamont oils). When I say this product has an artificially flavored TASTE I mean the taste TO ME does not taste like something in nature, even if it technically is trying to copy flavors (spices) that exist in nature. I hope I didn't confuse things more with my explanations.To Cafe Escapes' credit, there WERE some real spices (actual spices, not just spice flavoring) in there. This is evident because this is basically an instant powder they placed in a K-cup and the entire contents of the K-cup end up in your tea mug, so I notices some finely ground stuff spices in the mug after drinking.  So I applaud them for that.  At the same time though, there are lots of better quality instant mixes that one can just spoon into a cup and add hot water to that cost a fraction of these K-cups.  So that is why I believe this product truly isn't worth purchasing.Sorry for my ramblings, I hope I could help with what I meant in my review.

It's really hard to describe how delicious these cookies are, especially if you keep them in the refrigerator and then drink them with a cold glass of milk. There are only about 20 in a box, so they tend to go quickly, making them a bit on the pricey side. On the other hand, they're excellent for when you have friends over, and they compliment a scoop of ice cream quite well. The chocolate is semi-bitter, as you would expect, but the mint cream is right on target. Seriously, Junior Mints + Oreo cookie = Oreo Mint Fudge Cremes. ;)All that being said, having them shipped via UPS is a hit or miss proposition. The cookies really are not packaged in such a way that all off the tumbling about won't dislodge them from their tray. When I opened my box, about half of them had slid around for the journey to our front porch and were beginning to crumble around the edges. Also, is was wintertime, so the chocolate had started to oxidize a bit (which didn't affect the taste, but definitely the look). I took off one sar because of this, since I felt that in this case, the shipping process detracts from the experience of eating them somewhat (unless you like them already broken). If you plan to buy these from the local grocery, however, by all means, add the extra star back! :)", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "03 17, 2011", "summary": "Excellent!

I like it both as a dessert type after dinner coffee as well as an anytime coffee. I only drink coffee sweetened (preferably with honey) and with half and half, and that is how I sampled Melitta's Hazelnut Creme Brulee. My coffee of choice, which I've been drinking for about 2 decades, is Peet's brand coffee (which I get shipped to me and of which I enjoy and drink several varieties, with my top favorites being French and Italian). I always buy whole beans and grind beans one cup at a time. I then make it in a filter cone, and every once in a while in a French press or an espresso machine. If I'm making coffee for 2 or 3 people, I either use the French Press or I make each cup separately, using a separate filter cone for each cup. And I'm always careful when measuring beans and ground coffee so that I can keep the flavor and body of the coffee I drink day after day consistent. (The Melitta Hazelnut Creme Brulee is ground to an \"Extra Fine Grind,\" which means it's unsuitable for use in a French Press.)On a caffeine buzz scale, I find that Melitta Hazelnut Creme Brulee weaker than any variety of Peet's (or Starbucks), but that's fine with me because I don't always want or need a caffeine buzz as strong as the kind I get from a tall cup of Peet's (or Starbucks). Sometimes I regret getting a strong caffeine buzz because it leaves me feeling a tad headachey. So it's nice to know that there's a tasty, good quality alternative that is less intense on a caffeine buzz scale.I would, and probably will, buy Melitta Cafe Collection ground coffee on occasion (e.g., if I'm running low on Peet's or money to buy Peet's, or if I'm asked to bring ground coffee to a holiday gathering where it will be prepared in a coffee maker of some sort). I would like to try the Melitta Cafe Collection Parisian Vanilla variety, as well as their Vienna Roast (Peet's Vienna Roast was one of my favorites but they discontinued it) and Blanc et Noir (which, according to Melitta's site, is \"Deep with a Rich Finish\"). I have tried their Classique Supreme variety (and will review it separately), and like it as much as I like the Hazelnut. I received free samples of the Hazelnut Creme Brulee and the Classique Supreme for review purposes, but based on the prices listed at Melitta's site and here at Amazon I'd say that the price is right and is lower than I would've expected for coffee of this quality.Update: I spoke on the phone with a Melitta customer service representative about the difficulty I had opening both 11 oz. sample bags of their Cafe Collection coffee I received, and she said that Melitta recommends using scissors along the top.

On top of them were about 3 jalapeno slices, as rings. The main taste was of the olive oil and the fish. Then, as you ate the sardines a jalapeno taste came through.I generally like bland foods, and sometimes find jalapenos too hot. However, these were just right - not too hot, with enough flavor to give a jalapeno taste.I put the sardines on top of half a baked potato and used the excess oil to mash into the potato.  A salad accompanied the dish, making an excellent dinner for two from one tin.If you are looking for food that tastes like a hot chili, forget it. If you are looking for some pep in sardines that are in oil, this is a tasty, convenient snack.The pull-ring on the tin makes it convenient to open - you don't need a tin-opener. The wrap covering the tin could be easier to pull off - it needs a clear indication of where to tear or a red plastic ribbon to pull it open. I opened it with scissors.The picture on the packaging is amusing - it looks like the fish come from Norway. In fact, my sardines came from Poland and were distributed from San Diego, California.PS After looking at Wikipedia and noting one reviewer said the fish were brisling. I found brisling are small sprats from Northern Europe.  Sardines and pilchards from places like Portugal and Monterey, CA are different fish. According to Wikipedia, sardines and pilchards belong to several fish families:  Dussumieria, Escualosa, Sardina (the European pilchard (true sardine) is Sardina pilchardus), Sardinella and Sardinops.  Brislings, sometimes called Brisling Sardines, are young sprats, Sprattus sprattus, a herring-like fish.

And also other products.One other reviewer said that this is just the unflavored powder plus a hint of chocolate and doesn't taste that much better. I disagree. These things are never meant to satisfy tastebuds, but the chocolate one is still much easier to drink down than the original. It has just enough chocolateness to distract you from the otherwise very healthy and grass-y flavor (though freshly juiced wheatgrass is still much stronger).  I can just mix this with water and it goes down easy enough, unlike the original flavor, where I really have to force myself swallow or mix it with juice/protein shake to ease up the taste.As for the effectiveness, I really don't feel any energy-boost from it. However after two month and 3 cans of this stuff (2 chocolate ones and 1 unflavored), I can tell that my skin has a healthier look, and I in general feel cleansed internally and mentally. One of the most noticeable effect is that I poop a lot better with this. I'm not like constipated or anything, but this stuff takes it to another level. When my first can ran out I didn't restock for a month because I was sprouting alfalfas and thought that that plus some occasional wheatgrass shots would be good enough. However, during that month I could tell what my body missed without this stuff, so I immediate subscribed on amazon again.In general if you don't eat a lot of vegetables and fruits, you will find having this powder in your diet does help a lot. Even if you already do, this is still a nice add-on. The hint of chocolate is very helpful in making this healthy drink more drinkable.

It looks like Crisco but it's a bit harder & \"flakier\" when you scoop it out.  It melts around 75 degrees Fahrenheit, so it can be used wherever you would use shortening or lard - but this is presumably far healthier than either.  It has no discernible odor or flavor.  It just makes things oily.  Everybody knows it's fats that make food delicious!  I will definitely use this.  I made a batch of my special tofu curry, for which I usually use canola oil - I used this coconut oil instead and the results tasted exactly the same.  The label claims that coconut oil has a very long shelf life, which is good because usually I'm cooking for just one person, and I've had containers of oil & shortening go rancid before I was able to use it all.  Too bad Vine reviews have to be posted in a timely manner, or I'd wait a year to let you know how my jar of coconut oil has held up.  Maybe if I remember, I'll post an edit.  Until then I consider this product to be \"perfect\" and extremely useful as advertised.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "12 31, 2012", "summary": "That's coconut oil"}

Very surprised to find that they are really quite good! The texture is soft and chewy, and the flavor is very good -- just the right amount of cinnamon, and the raisins are actually there rather than (as is sometimes the case) just raisin bits.Each cookie is individually wrapped making them easy to take along for an on-the-go snack.While it won't stand up to a home-baked oatmeal cookie, for a store-bought cookie it's quite good. Definitely worth getting, especially if there is a price dip.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "10 28, 2013", "summary": "Very tasty"}
