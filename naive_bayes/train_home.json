Lets start with this, you wont use the little board unless you like having cheese parties or something of the sort.  Its too small for anything else.  The mid size board is useful for making a sandwich or something along those lines.  The largest of the three is the 'real' cutting board.I purchased this set as a quick replacement for an expensive John Boos cutting board that was ruined by a leaky faucet.  Wasnt really in the mood to spend $100 on another one, so I opted for a cheapo cutting board in the interim.  I was pleasantly suprised by these.First - use a wood or plastic cutting board, dont ruin your knives on a glass cutting board.  I know, these are wood, but I had to just throw that out there in case you were considering a glass option.Wood will cut 'faster' than plastic, meaning it will be easier to cut on a wood board.  Plastic will be easier to clean and sanitize afterward, plus you dont have to worry about warping or cracking.  I still prefer wood, and use the plastic board liners when Im cutting raw food with bacteria hazards, like chicken.These boards arrive oily.  Took a good cleaning to get the oily feeling off.  Im sure it was food safe oil, but Id still rather not eat it.  They are light weight for cutting boards too.  This can be useful if you prefer to keep them stored instead of constantly on your counter top.These are not 'end cut' boards, so they will be more likely to split and warp than some others.  For the price though, noone would expect otherwise.Overall, I was pleasantly suprised by these.  They were flat, smooth, and finished well.  The largest board is about the right size for an 8\" Chef Knife and able to accomodate a good sized roast.  The smaller boards are pretty limited on their usefulness, Id say more for presentation than funtion; like serving whole loaf bread or cheeses that will be cut and served at the table.Just for reference, these are not the same quality you get with a high end Butcher Block type cutting board, but for the price these cannot go wrong.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "11 10, 2010", "summary": "Great price on ok cutting board"}

This food processor is very powerful and will definitely dice your hand if you put it in there.Keep in mind that seven cups is a lot smaller than it seems.  I found this out when I decided to make a soup with all the squash that my CSA kept giving me.... if it is in liquid form and exceeds the height of the blade mechanism, then it will seep up and through the middle of the processor and spill everywhere out the base area.  If you want to make puree's or soups, you'll need something bigger.  This is made simply for chopping and maybe some small blending.Normally, this chops anything I throw in there to a very fine texture.  Leave it in there for longer and it comes to a chunky liquified form... good for making curry pastes or healthy spreads.  Every so often when I put a big chunk of garlic or a wedge of bell pepper, it will either get stuck under a blade or skip on the top for a while, making the bits inconsistent in size.  With a little poking, it'll be fine.  The lock in mechanism is very innovative, and the processor will not turn on unless this is locked in place.  It is made almost idiot proof, so you can't really turn it on and stick your hand in at the same time.Cleanup is relatively easy.  If you use a dishwasher, all the components can be taken apart with ease and thrown into a dishwasher.  I don't have one, so it's a bit trickier to wash by hand only because of the smaller areas, (the lock mechanism, the center tube, etc)  I don't use it all the time, but it is very nice to take out and push down a lever and watch stuff chop.I have limited experience with blenders and processors.  I have a hand-me-down blender that works amazing (old stuff was made to last) and this is my first processor.  The price seems high to me, but I really don't know if that's the norm or not.  Seems like a lot if you don't use it that often as I do.  But if you plan to use it a few times a week, it is probably a safe buy.

And I am very pleased to report that this one works as promised.  My first loaf came out tall and beautifully browned with a light and airy crumb as expected.  The loaf itself was quite beautiful with a great crown.  Fantastic bread maker.This breadmaker makes horizontal loaves, similar to those you find in the store.  Depending on the recipe you use, they will come out nice and fluffy. The shape of the pan, combined with the mixing power of two blades, means no leftover ingredients along the edge of the pan. The non-stick coating allows for easy cleanup. Just pop the bread out and place on a rack to cool.4/3/14I did a LOT of research before deciding on this product. And it seems to work so well for other people.  Keep in mind that I am not a beginning baker. I have made a number of loaves by bread machine and by hand as well.When my unit arrived, I raced home on a late lunch break, opened up all the packaging, plugged it in, whipped some egg whites, put everything in the pan (eggs, water, flour, gluten, salt, yeast all in the correct order), set it on the \"French\" setting for a two-pound loaf with dark crust and then returned to work. When I arrived home, there was still another hour or to go (I knew it wouldn't be ready until 7:30, but it was so hard waiting!). It smelled so good! When 7:30 finally arrived, the machine alerted me that my bread was done and I raced over. Sadly, what I found was bread that had crowned awkwardly and was all but completely raw. I tried expending the bake cycle, but after another fifteen minutes, opted for a preheated oven. It finished nicely in my oven and the bread was good, albeit a bit dense. I realize way too late in the process that I had added to much yeast. That explained the unusual shape, but not the way undercooked aspect. I decided that since it had been a while since I'd used a bread machine (although all previous bread machine attempts have performed beautifully with other machines) it could be user error.I made a new batch of a different bread (one that you can leave overnight) weighing the ingredients this time and set it to finish at six am. When it was finished, I was even more discouraged. My loaf had risen, then sunk and was again, way, way undercooked. I didn't have enough time to finish baking it in my oven so I ended up having to throw it away. I did a lot of research later that day and decided to give it another go.That night, I measured all of the ingredients with the measuring implements that came with the machine and exactly as specified in the manual. I even added extra flour, following the suggestion of one user and also working on the theory that'd perhaps the rain had made the air extra humid that day and perhaps it was just too wet.  Sadly, this morning, I awoke to the same caved-in, raw bread as before. Again, I didn't have time to bake it in my oven, so it looks like I've wasted even more flour and other ingredients.I am returning my unit, but sadly Amazon did not allow me to exchange it for another so I had to order a second one. It will be here on Saturday. I hope my unit was merely defective. I love bread, especially fresh, homemade bread. And I was so looking forward to making healthy bread for myself and my friends and family. Hopefully the next unit works out better. I really hope so.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "04 3, 2014", "summary": "Great Bread Maker, Beautiful Bread"}

I have not used the grill since then, but I will be sure to use more oil the next time.  I've made pancakes and eggs on the flat side, and by now, a couple weeks after buying it, I no longer have to use any oil to make it non-stick.

I noticed that the people who liked this the best used it for that purpose. If you look inside the unit you will see that there is metal in the back half of the refrigerator.

I've also place a can in a bowl of water placed in the back of the fridge and that stays cold (the water helps transfer the cold to the can). As almost all the reviews state, this unit has a very loud fan, so I don't recommend it for a bedroom. I keep it in my office and only turn it on at night.

It is hard to spend this much money on something and not know what you all think about it.  But...  I really wanted a square one, with a rear fan, and a 10 tray one, but the Excaliber was so expensive, and the reviews were iffy in the sound area and in the temperature control area. (I actually bought this from E-Bay, (better price and freebies too) and they have reviews, but I don't know if I can count on their review system like I can Amazon's.  Anyway, I took the plunge and bought this beauty, I think that the smaller size of the holes in the trays were what made the decision for me, along with the $100+ difference in the price, and the free silicone liner sheets.  It is quiet, efficient, and I just love it.  It came with 3 free silicone liner sheets for fruit leather that I would have had to pay extra for with the Excalibur and the Nesco, and it came with a face plate filler so that I can pull out 4 trays and make yoghurt in it if I want to.I have dried bananas, strawberries and oranges so far with great results.  I was surprised that the oranges were so good, never expected to like them, just did not want them to go bad, so I sliced them in whole circles and put them on the trays. They were crispy/chewy and sweet, and I will save the rinds and chop them in my blender to use later for recipes that call for orange zest. I made Essiene bread this last week, using sprouted wheat, raisins, and sunflower seeds.  It was very fast and with the openings of the trays about 1/2 inch, I put the patties right on the trays, no liner, and it was fine, no chunks falling through.  I love the separate temperature control, it is nice.  So far, 2 months later, I have no complaints except my family is eating the dried fruit as fast as I have time to make it, and I was hoping to store some of it.  My granddaughter has a sweet tooth, and she has her chubby little hands full of the bananas when she is here.  I would have loved to put some of the dried strawberries in my Mueseli, but they disappeared before I could sneak some away.  I am ready for summer to come (we are still having snow storms...) and for my garden to produce so that I can really put it to good use.  I will try jerky soon, but I have no doubt that it will do the job well.  I wanted to wait and write this review until I was sure it would work well for all of my needs, and I am confident to recommend this to anyone who is wanting a good dehydrator for a good price.  It is bigger than the Nesco, smaller than the Excaliber, at 10 square feet of drying space, it more than meets my needs.  It is just the right size for my counter, not too big, sits next to the microwave.  It makes less noise by far than my dishwasher or my stove hood fan.  I know it is on, but I can still think and hear what everyone is saying.  The kitchen smells wonderful while it is running as well, like whatever I am drying.  I expect to be able to take advantage of sales, Costco sized packages, and my garden offerings this year, without worrying about spoilage, plus save a little money, eat a little better.  Not a bad life...  grin...Customer service was amazing.  I received it within 3 days of ordering it, if you can believe that.  I actually had a problem with the unit.  It was explained to me that sometimes when the unit is drop shipped through UPS, they actually drop it, and the protective grill around the fan can get shifted.  Well mine did, and it had the fan blade trapped.  I turned on the unit and washed the trays off for my first use, but the fan blade was not turning and it melted.  Oh man, I had the trays full of sliced bananas and no dehydrator!  Bummer, plus my husband had already thrown the box away so how could I even send it back?  I did not want to send it back, I just wanted it to work!  I took it apart and could see where the problem was, this was a Saturday and their office was closed, so I E-mailed the company, Mercantile Station 2, asking them to send me a replacement fan blade.  Within 30 minutes I had a personal phone call (again, this is Saturday and they are closed) and a promise to ship me a new fan blade the following Monday.  He explained to me that about 1 in 80 customers had had this problem, (leave it to me to be the 1 in 80...) and that they were looking into their packaging to fix the problem.  Meanwhile he could not have been nicer, or more accommodating, and he was very grateful that I was willing to fix the problem myself.  Me too, I did not want to have to wait for an exchange, I just wanted to get it working, and it does, and I am one happy dehydrating woman!  So check that your fan blade is free of impingement before you turn your unit on, which is easy, just take out the trays and you can see all the inner workings.  FEEL CONFIDENT to purchase this unit and save a good $100+ over the other comparable units on the market.9/27/11  It has been 18 months since I purchased this and I still love it.  I have used it steady with no problems and I did not just forget I had it after a few uses.  I took a shelf out of my cupboard and set it there to get it off of my counter, out of sight.  I have made a lot of fruit leather, strawberries, bananas, apples, dried orange and grapefruit slices are divine, beef jerky, and I've even shredded carrots which was a lot of work, but it was fun to have a baggie of them to add to stews and soups.  I sprout my wheat and then dry it back out to grind to flour and save a lot of money doing this.  So far my favorite is dried tomatoes, so good to eat like a chip.  Slice the tomatoes stem to bottom, not side to side, in 1/4 inch slices.  I chop up fresh basil and salt to taste, mixed in with olive oil and dip the tomato slices in it and set them right on my trays.

They are marketed as a way of keeping spirits like bourbon or scotch cool, but for my review I used plain old cold water in a glass \"rocks\" glass.  I was not warned away from using them to keep opaque liquids like Ensure or orange juice cool, but was not exhorted to use them for that either, and decided not to.  The \"stones\" are really dice-shaped cubes in neutral shades of gray and comprised of soapstone, not granite (a distinction the vendor uses as a selling point).  Currently the price for the set of nine stones in a small velveteen bag runs half or less of the \"personal-luxury\" price of about forty dollars they used to sell for.  Instructions are simple: wash off the \"rox\" but do not dry them, and put them in the freezer.  A bag of nine is probably sufficient for the contents of two glasses.  They will keep the liquid contents of a glass cooler than nothing at all, and since there is nothing to leak there is no dilution by water as there would be with ice cubes.  I think these DrinkRox will serve as a nice small present for a friend or for oneself, especially if dilution of spirits by ice cubes is a problem.

It took me quite a lot of time to figure out how to process doughs with this machine. Initially it just beat them to death. Well, the not-so-difficult (to figure out) secret is to watch the temp of your liquids and to limit your processing time. (See comments for more details.) There also were quite a number of issues initially with processing cheeses. This issue has been totally resolved and the new manual gives clear instructions on how to effectively process cheeses. The Breville has now become my go-to food processor and I use it every day.Cuisinart: About the only time I pull out the Cuisinart is if I have limited time to do clean up between processing or if I am traveling and need to bring a machine along. I don't want to put my beloved Breville at risk (lol). The major issue I have with the Cusinart is the mold problem. I did get a replacement lid and was told (very firmly) that this was a one time thing. The design has not changed so, I am very cautious about clean up with it. I do not put it in the dishwasher and I try to dry every bit I can get to as soon as I can. I also have found that liquid and matter can get in the handle of the largest bowl through a small hole near the bowl opening. I have a small brush I use to get in to remove matter but I am concerned that mold will develop in that area over time. I really no longer can recommend this machine because of these issues.2012 Year End Update: I continue to use and appreciate both the Breville food processor and the Cuisinart. I do reach for the Cuisinart more frequently than the Breville but that is mainly because I use it to make some sort of dough on an almost daily basis. Please see the comments section of this review for a discussion of the cheese grating issues and the resolution for the Breville Food Processor. (Kudos to the company for resolving this issue.) Also please note, I have added a Cleaning section to this review based on issues with the Cuisinart food processor lid.Update:Cuisinart - After 4 months of regular use I have to say that this has become my \"go to\" machine. I typically need to make some sort of dough with my meals and so I use the large bowl for my dough and then the smaller bowls for slicing and dicing. My only complaints about this machine are that sometimes there is spill over from the smaller bowls to the larger bowls when processing the food and I have to keep a hand on the machine when kneading larger amounts of dough because it gets to rumbling and grumbling all over the counter.Breville - After repeated attempts at dough making with the Breville, I have concluded that it is simply not cut out for that sort of work. When I am making vegetable stock and need to chop up a lot of vegetables I do go with this machine because it is an absolute beast. I also like the french fry disc. I have also used the emulsifying disc and it is pretty effective but must be seated tight down on the base of the bowl or matter gets under the disc. My only other real complaint about this machine is that those little metal tips on the disc spindle and blades have burned me more times than I care to count, they get really hot and then tend to want to stick to the top of the lid when you pull it off.After putting up with a prehistoric GE 7 cup food processor for decades I finally decided to empty my wallet and buy a 14 cup Cuisinart Elite Collection food processor*Cuisinart FP-14DC Elite Collection 14-Cup Food Processor, Die Cast. Then, a week later I was given the opportunity to review this food processor. Can you say \"holiday time heaven\"? I put both machines through their paces cooking Thanksgiving Dinner and have continued to use them on an almost daily basis to do everything from simple slice and dice to whip, puree and knead.  They are both fine food processors, excelling in different areas. Here is a back-to-back comparison.Appearance:Breville - This is a beautiful machine, being sleek silver and coal black. The lid is a slide lock system and has a very wide feeding chute and a large food pusher with a smaller round pusher, (the small pusher is calibrated and can be used for measuring); the unit can run with the small pusher out but stops if the larger pusher is removed. (And starts right back up if it is put in - quite the shock if you forgot you had the machine running when you took it out.)Cuisinart - This is a very attractive unit but is a bit boxier than the Breville and not as expensive looking. The lid snaps on to the unit when two small buttons are pushed in on the large work bowl. There is a wide feeding chute with a smaller chute inset. And it comes with a retractable cord that can be extended a little or a lot.I really love certain aspects of both machines. The Breville really is a beauty; I like the measurement feature on the small food pusher and the fact that the large pusher is closed in at the bottom, so food does not get in the open part of the pusher when you use it. I am not crazy about the roundness of the small pusher though; functionally it is much less practical. I also love the retractable cord on the Cuisinart.Accessories:Breville -  Three Blades (Micro-serrated S blade, Dough blade and Mini processing blade), 5 discs (Adjustable Slicing Disc, Shredding and Grating Disc, Julienne Disc, Emulsifying Disc and French Fry and Vegetable Stick Disc), One Mini Bowl, a disc spindle, small brush and spatula, instruction booklet (with a few recipes) and storage container.  (Note: the blades have metal tips and can get quite hot after processing - so mind your hands when reaching into the bowls!) All bowls and attachments are BPA free.Cuisinart - Three Blades (Small Chopping/Mixing Blade, Large Chopping/Mixing Blade and Dough Blade.) Two discs (Adjustable Slicing Disc and Reversible Shredding Disc.), two smaller bowls with pour spouts, Stem Adapter, Spatula, Cleaning Tool and instructional DVD with recipes and spiral bound instruction manual with recipes. Accessory Storage Case.The Breville obviously has a greater number of accessories and the storage container is much higher quality than the Cuisinart. The Cuisinart container is a two level unit and the bottom drawer is clumsy to pull out and push in. On the positive side, only the Cuisinart container has a safety lock to keep little hands out.  The Breville brush and spatula are also better quality than the Cuisinart. That said, the instructional booklet from Cuisinart is far superior to Brevilles both in construction and content and the additional DVD is a godsend for those who are either visual or auditory learners. It is very helpful to be able to actually see someone use the food processor.  Also, certain of the Breville accessories must be washed by hand.Warranty:Breville - One year limited warranty on unit. Twenty-Five year induction motor warranty.Cuisinart - Three year limited warranty on unit. Twenty-year motor warranty.Controls:Breville - The unit has three button controls; Power Off, Start/Pause and Pulse. It also has an LCD display with a count up or count down timer.Cuisinart -. The unit has four buttons: On, Off, Dough and Pulse.I love the LCD display and counter feature on the Breville. As for the Cuisinart, the dough cycle is almost a must have for me since one of the primary reasons I wanted a good-sized food processor was because I am a baker.  (It is not my profession but is one of my passions.)Motor:Breville - 1200-watt induction motorCuisinart - 1000-watt peak power induction motorSlicing and Shredding:Breville - Shredding - the machine shines here. Shredded cheeses** are uniformly shredded with minimal powdering and there is quite a difference between fine and course shreds when the blade is turned. Slicing - simply excellent. I made a dessert that called for very finely sliced apples and I could not have asked for a more beautiful result.Cuisinart - Shredding - This unit isn't quite as good at shredding as the Breville. There is very little difference between the fine and medium shred on cheese and quite a bit of the cheese powders. (Not an issue for cooking but one if it is being plated.) Slicing - Very good results here too. Not quite as uniformly sliced as the Breville but close enough.Chopping:Breville - The top performer. You just have to be careful to keep the processing time down or you end up with grated not chopped!Cuisinart - Does a very good job but isn't quite the powerhouse the Breville unit has proven to be.Kneading:Breville - Oh dear, I am afraid I haven't had the best luck here. The machine is simply too powerful and your poor dough is easily beaten. I have tried several batches using this unit at the same time as the Cusinart and have never been able to get the same quality result. They really need to add a dough button to the controls.Cuisinart - Wow, fantastic results! Makes bread so light you can't tell the difference between that kneaded in the food processor and kneaded by hand!I made a double batch of baguette dough. I hand kneaded one third and put one third in each of the food processors. I kneaded the dough in the food processors until it formed a shaggy ball and then finished kneading by hand. The dough in the Breville was simply tough and even with much attention never recovered from the initial processing. The dough in the Cuisinart was easy to work with and felt \"just right\". When the three loaves were (blind) tasted side-by-side the family was split over whether the hand kneaded dough or the Cuisinart kneaded dough had the best texture and taste. All thought the Breville kneaded dough was on the tough side and a bit tasteless.Cleaning:Breville - the machine must be hand washed. Cleanup is a breeze and there are no issues with food being trapped in the lid seal.Cuisinart - I am very unhappy with the lid and seal is designed on this machine. I have to pick food out of the seal and between the seal and the lid most every time I use the machine. I also am having an issue with mold growing on the top of the seal where it is encased in plastic and unreachable for manual cleaning. I have been soaking the lid in a vinegar solution to deal with this but it is simply unacceptable to have these sorts of issues with a machine that is so expensive. The food processor is top rack dishwasher safe but I would give some thought to putting the blades and slicing/shredding discs in your dishwasher.Overall impression:Breville - this is a very fine, beautiful machine. If you are leaving it out on the counter and use it mainly for slicing, shredding, chopping, I highly recommend investing in this unit. That said; if you like to work with dough, consider investing in the Cuisinart.Cuisinart - Until I had the cleaning issues with the lid on this machine I thought that for the price this unit was a tough one to beat. Now I am not so sure. I very much appreciate and enjoy using the machine but am completely put off by the fact that I have to actively watch for and address mold forming in the seal area of the machine. I recently picked upThe Best Bread Ever: Great Homemade Bread Using your Food Processorand am going to work on using it with the Breville after the first of the year. If I can figure out how to make a great dough using this machine then the Cuisinart will be relegated to the back shelf.*I had a watch on it on camelcamelcamel and there was a price dip.** Please see comments section for a discussion of recommendations for shredding cheese and warranty implications.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "12 7, 2011", "summary": "Breville vs. Cuisinart Chop Wars!"}

Love the system, hate the waste and big-time expense of using a new pod for each cup and then tossing. Tried the reusable mesh cups (not Keurig) from Amazon and they are not bad but you have to hold your cup up to outlet or it sprays coffee all around. Also grounds in holder and in brewed coffee sometimes a problem. YUK! Received the My-Kaps last night and used 1 twice this morning and I love them. They are FAR thicker and heavier than pictured. Think disc of hard plastic not flimsy top from take-out tartar sauce. So each kap is going to be good for numerous uses. I looked at the various offering on the company web site and while you can buy these without the brush and removal tool, I recommend getting the kit that has them. Don't think I'll use the cleaning brush to 'sweep' out the used grounds since a clean child's soft tooth brush works very well. However, the kap removal tool is great for  extracting kap from top of K-cup (kaps actually fit down inside top of pod not over the top). And in the grand scheme of things and for morning serenity, the small extra expense is well worth it. Also, when you place the filled pod into the holder, rotate it until the hole in the bottom slides over the needle so you're not punching new holes each time. The instructions call for using an espresso grind, but I had some regular grind gift coffee handy and used it without regrinding. Worked fine.

The plates come out very easily and are dishwasher safe. I found they're also very easy to wash by hand, if you prefer. (The unit comes with a scraper for easy cleaning of the grill sides.) The nonstick coating also seems very thick and durable; we haven't had any problems with it flaking off.So far, I've used it for cooking steak, fish, pancakes, panini and French toast. All have cooked up beautifully, except for the French toast -- and that was my fault, because I forgot to use butter the grill first, and the bread stuck to the plates. (I did butter the next batch, and that turned out just fine.) The fish and steak grilled in record time, because they're being heated on two sides, not just one. And the panini were delicious! I would suggest that you use a very thick, sturdy bread, though -- like French bread not Wonder bread -- to ensure your panini isn't squished. The top is rather heavy.I especially love that you can lie the unit flat for lots of grilling/griddle space. I don't have a large griddle pan or skillet, so before when I cooked pancakes, we'd either have to keep them hot in the oven or eat one person at a time.

Rodriguez", "helpful": [52, 54], "unixReviewTime": 1231027200, "reviewText": "After doing a lot of research, I settled on purchasing this indoor grill for use in my apartment. I've used it thus far to make chicken, burgers, and pork chops. Here's my rundown:Pros======- Gets HOT--the manual says the temperature range goes up to 410F, but my infrared thermometer shows my grill surface reaching 550F and above. This is good, of course, since it gets closer to imitating the high temperatures a real grill.- Grill surface is really nonsticky--nothing I've cooked so far has been able to stick to it. Of course, you can't use any metal utensils/spatulas/tongs on it (it will scratch the nonstick coating) so make sure you have nonstick-safe cooking tools before grilling.- Grill surface is heavy and dense--this means it's going to hold its heat better which is important when grilling.Cons======- No lid--to me, this is one of the main reasons I knocked it down a star. No included lid means your only method of heat transfer into the food is going to be conduction, which is fine for thin foods, but for thick foods the outside is going to burn before you can cook the inside fully. On a real grill, you can put the lid on so that it acts as an oven in addition to a grill. Since there's no included lid, you'll have to stick to thinner foods (or I suppose you could sear the outside on the grill and finish the thick meat in an oven, but that kind of defeats the point of having a grill).- Tedious to clean--despite the nonstick cooking surface being extremely nonsticky, it's still a pain to clean because of all the small slats and the burnt fat that can buildup in between the slats. The manufacturer should have included a shaped cleanup tool like the George Foreman grills have, but I find using one of those handheld dishwands (with the scrubber that's safe for nonstick pans) is the easiest tool to cleanup the grill.- Still not \"smokeless\"--despite what the manufacturer or anyone says, this grill is definitely not smokeless. This isn't so much a fault of this grill in particular, but rather a consequence of extremely high heats plus oil/fat. It's just going to happen. The drip tray does help some, but if you have a rub or a lot of seasoning on your meat, that's also going to add to the smoke as some of the spices blacken. It's still not too bad though, and nothing an open window and a box fan can't alleviate.Overall======This grill is an acceptable substitution for a real grill for those who are unable or unwilling to own a real grill. No, you're not going to get that charcoal taste (but you can get a smoked taste by marinating/brining your meat with a liquid smoke product), but your meat is still going to get nice grill marks and taste pretty good. I do recommend this grill!Extra tip: If you're like me and prone to under/overcook your meat, take a tip from Alton Brown and brine your poultry/pork! I brined my boneless/skinless chicken breasts and after grilling them on this grill, they were so unbelievably juice and tender I had to double check their temperature to make sure they were fully cooked. The texture and juiciness can't be beaten, even if you overcook!", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "01 4, 2009", "summary": "Great Indoor Grill"}

At that price, it's definitely a good deal for what you are getting. If you bought all these pieces separately, the cost would be much higher. I did read a lot of reviews noting the \"Pyrex controversy\" prior to purchasing, and gave it a quick Google search and read. However, considering the price, and the fact that I am pretty careful with my glassware items, I went ahead and purchased this set.A few considerations: I compared the glass to the other Pyrex pieces I own (which are probably about 10 years old), and the thickness of the glass is about the same. The appearance (look and shape) has taken on a more modern design. The photos should be updated because the set I received looks different...the handles of the pans are not solid glass, but are larger with holes in them, making the overall shape/design of the pans quite different. The bright red-orange colored lids are somewhat unpleasant to the eyes...okay, ugly (in my opinion). I would prefer white, dark blue, or at least a darker red. The lids for the mixing bowls fit well. However the lids for the 3-quart oblong and the 8 inch square do not fit as securely as they could/should to preserve the freshness of foods inside. It seems as though the manufactures were trying to achieve a good design by contouring the lid shape around the handles of the pans, rather than covering them (as the ones pictured do). However, something didn't quite work, and they don't line up as well as they should...the fit just doesn't have a good, snug \"feel.\" This is my main complaint about the set. While still fully functional, there is room for improvement here. Oh, and the pie plate is \"standard size\" (a very shallow 1 and a quarter inches deep). I wish it had included a deep-dish pie plate.These issues aside, longevity and shatter resistance remains to be seen and will take time and usage to determine.

You select from three cutting grates: large squares, small squares, or slices.  You select one of the grates and place it on the base of the device, place the food on the chopper blade, and push the hinged lid closed.  This forces the food through the grille and--voila--your food is chopped.As an extra bonus, there are measuring lines drawn on the side.  If you tilt the device on end, you can see if you have enough, say, chopped onions without having to use a measuring up.Is this genius?  No.  Is this new, innovative, and oh-so-different than anything out there in the market? Absolutely not.  However, the chopper is simple, easy to use, and light weight.  Whether you are making sweet potato fries, chopping onions, or cutting harder cheeses in cubes or strips it is simple and just works.  This is an easy to use, easy to clean, device that doesn't take up a lot of room, but might save you a lot of time.The device could probably chop just about anything but, for me, worked best on larger more solid types of food.  Potatoes and crisp sweet potatoes worked exceedingly well. (Note: very fibrous sweet potatoes that weren't so crisp didn't work well in the system.  For some reason they were trouble.  However, another crisp and seemingly less fibrous variety worked famously in the machine.  You may have to experiment at first with what works.)  If you want strips or slices you give them one pass.  If you want cubes, you put them through for a second pass.  Solid fruits, such as apples and firm pears worked well too. Onions were diced with one pass.  Note, however, firmness is key. If the onion is on the riper side, it still works, but there can be some slippage.  Celery, carrots, and parsnips all worked pretty well, but were less convenient as you need to cut them in strips that fit on the chopper blade and you can't really stack them.Certain veggies, such as tomatoes, didn't work as well.  Sure, if you have a more solid beefsteak tomato without a lot of seed or pulp it would probably be okay.  But if your have a less meaty tomato that has a lot of pulp/seeds, you will pulverize more than you chop.  The same goes for ripe pairs, bananas, softer cheeses etc.  Softer things that don't hold their shape don't work as well.Given the incredible sharpness of the blades, there was little slippage of the food while chopping.  With a tiny bit of pressure, the food anchors quite well.  The sharpness of the blades is also key when it comes to ease of use.  You do have to apply some pressure for things like hard, firm, white potatoes to initiate the cut, but so long as you put a little of your weight into it wasn't a problem.  Once again, if the blades should become dull, this might be a bit of a chore.Clean up wasn't bad at all.  The bulk of the device can easily be cleaned in soap and water and--I believe--is even dishwasher safe. There is a cleaning tool that will help you easily pick food pieces from the top of the device, where there is a square pattern that helps prevent slippage.  Without the tool, this would be difficult to clean.  The blades are dangerously sharp. There is a thick plastic frame around each, so handling isn't a problem.  They generally rinsed clean well, but as far as I can tell, the blades themselves are not dishwasher safe.  Be very careful when cleaning to avoid injury.  (The blades are razor sharp the way blades on a mandolin slicer are sharp.  The thing that makes this device safer than the mandolin-type slicers is that everything is covered while you are doing the chopping so you don't expose your fingers to injury the same way.)Blades can be stored in the bottom of the closed chopper.  This is nice, as it means that there are no exposed sharp edges to snag and cut you if you are reaching for the device in the cabinet.One caveat: this is not the device you would use for industrial sized cooking.  The area of the cutting blades is small and some larger vegetables need to be cut down to fit the size of the cutting surface.  Additionally, you have to be careful about vegetable height, as the vegetable can't be too tall for the hinge.  But if you're preparing dinner for 1-8 people it worked just fine.  Another issue: the effectiveness of the chopper really depends on the fact that the blades are razor sharp.  They will likely become dull over time and if that happens the device will be close to useless.  The device--with the exception of the blades themselves--is made of hard plastic.  This is not an heirloom kitchen device that you will pass on to your children, but in practice seemed sturdy enough for the job at hand.On some level, this is a 3-trick pony: it slices and cuts strips in two sizes.  It is easy to discount this as yet another superfluous kitchen device, but the fact that it is small, easy to use, and does the job quickly make it a real asset and something that I used far more than I ever thought I would.  Simple things like chopping up onions for sauteeing: just strip the onions, stick them serially into the device, and--bam--you are done.  No lengthy dicing and the size of the chopped onions is uniform.  The same was true of making fries or cubing cheddar.  It was all much faster than usual and actually justified the time it takes to clean up the machine afterwards.I'm not a person who likes buying a kitchen device for every little chore, but although it's repertoire is limited, this one actually seems to work well and has become a go-to device in my kitchen.  Surprisingly, I like this device and see myself using it a lot in the future.

A knob of peeled garlic goes in the hopper, swing the arm over, and squeeze. Stress relief, plus perfect garlic! Entertaining though a garlic press might be, is it really a necessary tool in your kitchen? In its favor, a garlic press is very handy for giving you a uniformly &#8220;minced&#8221; garlic that&#8217;s much smaller than we could get by hand. For those of us who love garlic flavor in every bite, or if you&#8217;re a little shy about your knife skills, this is fantastic. A garlic press is also very useful for those times when we need to crush a lot of garlic at once. On the other hand, it&#8217;s a kitchen uni-tasker that takes up space in our drawer. The hopper gets clogged with garlic skins and becomes difficult to clean, especially if we forget to do it right away and the skins start to dry.When we&#8217;re chopping vegetables for dinner anyway, it feels easier just to mince the garlic along with everything else rather than pull out another tool. If you&#8217;re nervous about mincing something so small with a knife, it&#8217;s just as easy to crush it with a dinner fork as it is to use a garlic press. On the whole, we&#8217;re not convinced that this is a necessary tool in our kitchens, but that doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s not handy!I was sent the Propresser Garlic Press Stainless Steel Garlic Mincer and Ginger Press Garlic Press: Should You Buy One? ~ Review to check out for myself and I honestly have to say I really like it. If anything, it looks appealing! What I like about it is that one does not have to peel the garlic. Just put it into the compartment, vigorously squeeze, and scrape out the crushed peel. It&#8217;s that simple! The results come out amazing if you ask me! I found that the press is sturdy and feels as if it will hold up quite well for plenty of future use. I particularly love that it&#8217;s made of stainless steal just for that reason.Also, I found the handles to be ergonomic and comfortable for use. After pressing the garlic MOST of the cleanup was done by simply rinsing the press in warm water for a few seconds. I gave it two swipes with a brush and it was as clean as new. This unit is dish washer safe and of course we will always clean it with hot soapy water or in the dish washer. Overall I&#8217;m quite impressed and like the garlic press.

They can be found here on Amazon and also in other online marketplaces.  The problem is telling the quality chairs from the cheap knockoffs.  Having now owned a pair of these chairs for a bit, I can tell you these are very high quality chairs.The two chairs arrived in one box, but they were well packaged and protected for shipping.  They each took 2 minutes to assemble with no hassle and no tweaking necessary: simply tighten four screws to attach the preassembled base to the shell.  The bottoms of the shells have sturdy screw holes that look like that will last and be able to handle constant use.  The bases themselves were made of nice wood dowels and the metal supports also seem strong enough for regular use.  I weigh about 200 pounds and there is no sign that these chairs are going to bend under the pressure.One of the bases had some slight black scuff marks on them that wouldn't come off easily.  They were relatively minor, but when I raised the issue with the seller they quickly insisted on sending a replacement base.  Given how well packaged the chairs were and the excellent customer service, the only possible conclusion was that this was a rare fluke.  I have no hesitancy from purchasing from this seller again.I don't need to describe the beauty of these chairs, they are classics.  I was surprised, however, at how comfortable they are.  The shells have just the right amount of flex to give a little when you lean back, but they also don't seem flimsy.  They worked just as well for me, at 6'4&#34;, as for my shorter wife and even my little children.  I was a little worried that the white chairs would quickly look dirty, but with a quick wipe with a damp cloth they look as good as new.  Everyone that has seen them has loved them and asked where I got them.  I'm sure I will be sending them all to Laura Davidson soon, and even picking up some more for myself!Note:  the seller graciously provided me with a pair of these chairs to review.  I made no promise of a positive review and this review is a true reflection of my thoughts about the chairs.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "06 18, 2014", "summary": "Excellent, High Quality Reproductions of a Mid-Century Classic"}

The manual mentions an optional 'carpet glider' part that's not included but should be available to order from Bissell.I was surprised how quickly the mop started to produce steam, within seconds of plugging it in, and how effective and easy to operate it was due to the swivel joint connecting the mop's body to the head. The mop travels almost effortlessly on the floor unless there is some mess to take care of in which case you may want to lower the scrubber attachment to clean the grout between tiles and/or let the mop rest on top of an area that needs some more serious sanitizing.The fragrance discs are quite... fragrant if you use a full disc but you can easily cut them and use a half or less for a more bearable 'fresh' smell. They are soap-like and one disc or half disc should last for more than one steam-mopping session once its inserted into the pad's inner pocket.

It is 12 cups as you would see measured on a coffee maker carafe, which is 6 oz. per cup.I read a lot of people complaining about how thin the glass is.  Yes it is thin, but I don't feel like it is any thinner than a coffee maker carafe.  Gotta be careful you don't bang it into anything.I bought it mainly to brew tea for iced tea, and I was not aware that you could not put your tea bags directly in the pot.  I don't understand this warning, and I can't find any explanation anywhere as to why you should not do so, but since they warn against it I now have to pour the hot water onto the tea bags in my plastic pitcher...which is what I was trying to avoid in the first place.We have well water here, which is hard water, and after using the kettle only 3 times I noticed how foggy the glass has become.  I can clean it out with some vinegar but I would like to be able to leave the kettle sitting out on my stove between uses and not have it look 'dirty' until I get the time to vinegar-wash it.  I know I should have thought of that before I bought a clear glass kettle!Now here is the reason I wouldn't buy this again...I have an electric stove with coils.  I must use the diffuser under the kettle as per the instructions.  The transfer of heat through this diffuser is so slow that the first time I tried to boil water with the kettle 3/4 full, it took nearly an hour to boil.  I had set the stove to medium heat as recommended.  I've since learned that I have to set it on at least medium high if I want my water boiled in less than 1/2 an hour.  I don't think I'm supposed to use it on heat that high, so I'm halfway expecting this kettle to crack wide open some day soon.I really don't care about the whistling feature, but I will mention for people that do care--it is a low gentle noise, not a high-pitched whistle that you could hear throughout the house.  The first time I heard it I immediately thought of the sound of wind blowing in an empty bottle on a windy day.Since I use this kettle on the small electric coil on my stove, I have not experienced any issues with the handle getting hot or melting like some other reviewers have mentioned.  I think the key would be to always use the small burner on electric stoves, and keep the flame down on gas stoves.I think I'm going to try to find one of the old Corningware kettles to replace this pot.  Those did not require diffusers, were sturdier, and were not clear so they will hide the hard water film.", "overall": 2.0, "reviewTime": "04 15, 2014", "summary": "I wouldn't buy this again."}

This urban shelf experience is one of those instances.  The instructions are lacking and are the reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5.  Please read below so you won't experience the same problem I had when I tried to put together this easy to assemble unit.In addition to the shelf, you'll receive the legs and bags containing the parts you'll need to build it.  You'll get four of each of those parts.  Pay particular attention to the legs' grooves and the bag that contains 4 pairs of interlocking rubber braces (totaling eight).  Each of those eight rubber braces, which are called cups at the Amazon website, is about two inches high.  Examine the braces carefully, for the inner side of each has a thin linear relief.  The relief has to be aligned with the leg's upper groove before you lock it around the leg with its partner.  If you do that properly, the two parts will snap snuggly around the leg.  Also, most of the legs' grooves are evenly spaced, except one at the end that allows for a longer spacing at each leg's bottom.  Ergo, the longer space is at the bottom of the table's leg and the shorter space is on the top, and it's the area where you will snap the brace onto the leg.  That brace and its leg will now slip into the table's top with ease.  If your hands are too weak to push the leg into the table shelf, you can pound it in gently with a rubber mallet.  By the way, make sure the table's top is facing in the right direction, with its skirt facing down, toward the legs.The assembled table is 16 \" high and the top is 13 3/4\" square.  To make it high enough for a regular table, you might want to purchase two units.  One will easily piggyback onto the other with the included hardware.  I bought two to use side by side in the tub for clothing that has to drip dry.The manufacturer does warn you not to use this shelf (or table) as a step ladder or permit children or animals on it.  Also, distribute weight evenly.  It's safe and sturdy enough for inanimate objects, such as books, dry goods, or clothing.  I live in a small apartment and I had bought the initial unit with the intention of resting the small Panda washing machine or a wash bucket in the bathroom where they could then easily drain into the tub.  I haven't used it for that purpose, however, since I'm now thinking of purchasing a larger portable washing machine.  Besides, it probably isn't sturdy enough to withstand the vibrations of a washing machine, unless the legs are restrained at the bottom with something as simple as a tightly secured rope or duct tape that will join all four legs together. That can be an eyesore.  The table is still handy to receive a pizza delivery or to rest a grocery bag while I transfer items into the refrigerator.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "06 22, 2013", "summary": "Easy to Assemble"}

I've been dreaming of a machine that would let me vacuum and mop at the same time. The DC 56 does a pretty good job of that, although it isn't perfect.The lack of an on/off switch is shared with the DC 35 and almost caused me to return that unit. Due to hand and wrist pain there is literally no way I can use a machine that I have to squeeze the entire time it is running. With the DC 35 I sewed some Velcro on a strap; with the DC 56 I made a strap with snaps on it. If you don't sew, you might be able to use a spring clamp or cable tie.I agree with some comments that the vacuum function is impaired compared to the DC 35. I'm not sure if it's the squeegee plastic getting in the way or the opening isn't large enough or what. However, I do not have a lot of pet hair, just dirt and fir needles tracked in by my husband and things dropped on the floor in the course of cooking or eating. For those things, the DC 56 does an adequate job.As far as the mopping function, I won't use the Dyson pads. I'll just continue to do what I've done with the swiffer - I made my own microfiber pads (super easy if you have a serger; otherwise you can cut to size and overcast or zigzag the edges). If you don't sew, look online, there are lots of places to purchase reusable microfiber pads. The DC 56 will fit a swiffer-sized pad. I put about a quarter cup of vinegar in a measuring cup and fill the rest with water. I put the cloth in and then squeeze it out and put it on the machine. As I go around the house, I carry the measuring cup and periodically just pour a little more water on the pad. That way no issues about lack of moisture and I don't have to squeeze anything like a spray bottle.My biggest criticism about the DC 56 is the battery. With the DC 35, it pops right out. I bought a spare so I always have one charged, and I know I won't have to landfill the machine once the battery dies out. With the DC 56, the battery does not appear to be removable and the manual says to call Dyson if you ever need to replace the battery. I both called and e-mailed - the people on the phone said it is user replaceable but you will have to use a screwdriver; the e-mail people said it is not recommended to be replaced by the user. When I replied to the e-mail asking about what I had been told over the phone they said it was not recommended for users to replace the battery but it would be possible. There's still no information about this issue on the Dyson website. I almost returned it because of that issue.After giving it a good test, though, I am going to keep it. Bottom line it does an adequate if not perfect job of allowing me to vacuum and mop my hard floors with one pass, and it saves me time and work and leaves my floors looking nice.Dyson, if you're listening, here's my wish list for your next version: 1) please do a combination of the DC 35 and the DC 56 so I can have one unit and just switch out the head depending on whether I want to mop or just vacuum; 2) please add an on/off switch; 3) please improve the vacuum function with the mop head; 4) make the battery is user replaceable like the DC 35.", "overall": 3.0, "reviewTime": "09 30, 2013", "summary": "A good machine but needs some improvements"}

Initially, I suspected no malice on the part of the OXO caddy. However, it soon became clear that there was some sort of kitty vendetta in effect.After reassuring the cat that the bathroom was indeed safe, he mustered up the courage to once again attempt to go. Without fail, the caddy came crashing down once more, this time disassembling itself in spectacular fashion. The cat, naturally, bolted and decided that the bathroom was booby trapped. As a pet owner, this mindset was of particular concern. After examining the caddy and confirming that it was indeed in pieces, I decided that the third time was not, in fact, the charm, and decided that it would be better suited in the trash.The cat supervised all of this, staring at the OXO caddy with a mixture of fear and contempt.

The first set was the 15 piece set.They are stamped steel, which is reflected in the cost. I was very happy with my previous set, and used the honing steel on them probably every 3 uses. Not every single time, and sharpened them properly about every 6 months. They have no rust spots, and have been used extensively and regularly for about a year.This set has more knives, in sizes and shapes that I'm already getting a lot of use from. I like the lighter weight, as long as they are kept honed and sharpened as needed, the blades can do the cutting without having to power through with weight. Like my previous set, I'm finding that honing every few uses is working out just right to keep the blades aligned and cutting easily.The shears are fantastic. They come apart easily for cleaning. I use them all the time, to cut corn tortillas to make baked corn chips, on boneless skinless chicken breasts and thighs for soup, to cut the shells on lobster tails and to cut herbs for cooking.The description is accurate. Full tang with riveted handles. I recommend hand washing for all kitchen knives.

That is what it's for, after all, use on different foods in different applications. That's why it comes with so many different attachments, and claims to have 5-speed turbo. Sounds like great options and versatility! Here's my opinion about the instructions of use and my experience using it.The instruction booklet isn't well-organized.  I found myself flipping back and forth through the pages trying to learn which blade to use for which function:  Photo page, chart with each blade, \"Blade\" pages, or reading little 'tips' on random pages. The emphasis in the instruction book seems to be on the product before the function.  For example, there should be a listing of functions, such as \"Whipping egg whites, cream, frosting,...\" then indicate the Aerator Blade.There are some confusing instructions: P. 5 PicaTutto blade \"Crush\" lists Frozen Drinks.  P. 8 shows the MiTutto in the beaker with what appear to be ice cubes.  Pg. 14 states \"To Crush Ice Use the food processor to crush ice\".With 6 different attachments, it seems as though this product is trying to do too many things with too many pieces.  I would prefer less blades and one or two that are more versatile. However, the blade-removal tool does work perfectly and easily. Also, I would prefer the numbers on top for speeds be painted or somehow easier to see.I would not utilize the wall-mount bracket at all.  With all the pieces that need to be stored, it's just as easy to store everything in a drawer or cabinet put away.The puree function of the processor bowl was exceptional on cooked pumpkin. After 6 uses, the \"ON\" button doesn't work, only the Turbo.  It has been used to puree, whip egg whites, and make smoothies with small frozen fruit. These are hardly the foods which would exhaust a motor, and yet, it's exhausted. At this point, I can't use this product since it quit working on the normal speeds.Overall, this is a kitchen tool trying to do too many things with too many pieces and not enough power. I will look for something simpler and hopefully more reliable.", "overall": 2.0, "reviewTime": "11 15, 2011", "summary": "Worked great 6 times, then it didn't"}

I own the colbalt blue model, which was a birthday gift from my wife. (Actually, I would have selected a different color but I wasn't about to complain!)Before you buy one, do you have a place to put it? Mine resides on top of the refrigerator in my small galley-type kitchen. If you have limited counter space, it eats up quite a bit of room if you plan to keep it there. It won't set on top of your microwave oven unless you have a big commercial unit -- it's simply too heavy and might cause problems with the microwave. If it's stored in any spot not protected from dust, then you'll need to buy a cover for it right away. These are available as an accessory but my mother-in-law made one for me and it works great.I cook from scratch mostly about five out of seven days, I'm retired and my wife still works full-time. She likes to cook (and bake) on weekends. I use the KitchenAid about once every two weeks and my wife uses it with about the same frequency. If she's just doing a little job, she grabs her older hand-held electric blender with the pop-off beaters and that way she doesn't have to get the small stepladder and wield the HEAVY KitchenAid from the top of the fridge. We pretty much reserve it for bigger jobs.If there's going to be several batches of cookies made or bread dough whipped up, then it's for certain a KitchenAid job. I also make bulk amounts of Italian salad dressing with the Kitchenaid which has to emulsify over a 20-30 minute period -- with the KitchenAid, this is a hands-off process, easy.I also use a meat grinder attachment for making up four-pound batches of ham salad spread. This attachment is an extra 50 bucks but well-worth it. My brother uses this same attachment plus one other unit to make home-made Italian link sausage and it's well up to that job too.The KitchenAid is a breeze to clean, with no difficult hideaway places to have to dig dough out of. The dough hook, blender, and whip are just dropped into the dish water and they clean right up, very easy.This unit will do a great deal more than I'm using it for. Any KitchenAid Mixer will last for years and years, a lifetime I'd say.So, to finalize, I give the KitchenAid Mixer my highest recommendation:1. ...so long as you can afford it along with any additional necessary attachments, and,2. ...so long as you have a convenient place to store it.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "05 26, 2008", "summary": "Things to consider when buying a KitchenAid Mixer"}

Little did I know that I had some issues with the grill and could not get it to work. So, what next? Well, I have a Rotisserie Grill that I use to make rotisserie chicken. Usually, I have to keep poking it with a knife to see whether the center is done. Although, there is a timer based on what food you cook, I want to be certain. So, this handy pocket size thermometer came in very handy. It's more reliable than this other smaller plastic thermometer that I had. I've also done audits for restaurants before and this would have come in handy as well since the digital reading is very clear and concise as well as accurate. Furthermore, when testing meats baked in the oven, simply pull out the shelf and test it. Do NOT leave this in the oven as it is not meant for that. Even though I haven't used this for the barbecue grill yet, I can still take advantage of this gadget's multi-purpose attributes.Pros:-Pocket size is great (just a word, why not keep this in your purse so when you go out to eat, you can make sure that your meat is done properly. So many people get sick because of under-cooked meat - now you can be proactive instead of reactive)-Multi-Purpose usage (use in the kitchen or outside with the grill, carry with you out to eat, use as appointed)-Clear and easy to read LCD display-Great safety cover so your thermometer won't become damaged in your kitchen drawer-Hypoallergenic Stainless Steel Probe-Power Saving Auto Shut Off feature-Bonus Included- Special Cooking Mastery Guide eBook-Lifetime Satisfaction Guaranteed (wonderful benefit for a product like this)Cons:-None reported.About the Seller:I ordered my Cooking Thermometer from Magic Touches on 7/15/13 and it arrived on 7/17/13...on time and neatly packaged. The seller also sent properer verification as to when the product would be delivered and when it shipped. This gratuitous product was provided commensurate for my unbiased review and equitable opinion. Furthermore, I received follow-up emails from the seller to ensure my satisfaction with helpful tips and instructions. The bonus was also quite helpful for any cooking aficionado.Recommendations:To the Manufacturer: Try making brighter color options for the person who likes choices and who wants to color coordinate their utensils.To the Seller: Great product and thank you for the lifetime replacement guarantee.To Potential Customers: If you want to step outside the box and use this is various ways...go ahead.

I have no idea where it came from, I may have gotten it by default when I got married.  It has served me well over the years.But it has some scratches and the non-stick coating is getting rough (still doesn't stick, looks like it is slightly bubbling.)

I also ordered aRevere Convenience 12-Inch Skilletthinking it could replace my smaller 10 inch pan that was also showing some scratches.I received the Anolon 14 inch skillet and hauled out my tape measure and it has roughly a 10 1/2 inch base.  The same as the cheaper, and smaller sized Rever Convenience 12-Inch Skillet.  The top is 14 inches in diameter, but the base is the same as my 12 inch skillet.How is that helpful?  This is just a more expensive, takes up more space on the stovetop skillet with the same cooking surface area of my 12 inch Revere skillet!I am not happy at all with this.

I am a self-admitted cleaning-challenged person.  I simply hate to clean and pretty much won't spend time on hands and knees with an old toothbrush getting those nooks & crannies.  My back problems pretty much prevent this. Hence, my purchase of this product.  I have found that it works just as I expected - great for nooks and crannies.  I'm not super psyched about the wedge tool for flat surfaces, but then again, my flat surfaces are not my problem.  Time will tell if this gets used much.  I will say I love the mini brush tool (two come with the steamer) and I can see how I will wear these out rather quickly!  I wish there was a mini cone brush attachment (for inside tight spaces instead of just direct steam) is my only wish and I also wish there was an extension rod for it so I didn't have to get on hands and knees with back issues...I would recommend this product however.  It works great for what it is designed to do!  The large slender tool worked excellent for getting under and around the refrigerator and dishwasher in other places that probably haven't been cleaned in years!  I must say my husband's shower (which in 16 years we've lived here I personally have cleaned less than 5 times since he usually does it) was quite disgusting - many stains of black and yellow on the bottom and mold around the corners.  I worked about 15 minutes on the bottom of the shower with the mini brush tool (perhaps a bigger brush would also be handy?) and although I have more work to do, I can see this machine making the shower look new again once I have the opportunity to work on it more!

The edges are works of art, the blades perfect, the synthetic wood handles would be the envy of lesser blades.  I literally shaved with the parer!

You can put an empty bowl on the scale, press the button, and it will go to zero, and then you can add and weigh the food. You can choose to take the bowl off the scale and add the food to the bowl on the kitchen counter - the scale will show the weight of the bowl in the negative - then just put the bowl with food back on the scale to get the weight of the food.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "06 16, 2009", "summary": "Great scale"}

The trick is to make sure the crock is dry when you load it with butter, as any water on the inside walls will prevent the butter from sticking, and to pack it firmly.  It also helps to soften the butter on the counter or in the microwave before you pack it into the crock, and if you're going to scoop some butter out and then put back the unused part, make sure it's soft and that you pack it firmly onto the butter that's already there or that extra little bit _will_ fall out easily.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "08 17, 2010", "summary": "Looks great, works well"}

I haven't assembled furniture that was as easy as the Yube Cubes since the days when assembling furniture meant stacking bricks and boards to make a bookshelf.  I'm really surprised that some folks found them hard to put together.  Maybe I lucked out and got really well-matched pieces or something.  I also found the pictorial instructions easy to follow, with their printed tips at just the right points in assembly.Each piece is made of lightweight, eco-friendly materials and is easy to handle.  In addition to being lightweight, the pieces are small enough to maneuver easily, with no awkward juggling, twisting, and turning, no getting up and down off the floor or longing for assistance to hold one piece in place while you finagle another.  The pieces snap and clip together with almost no tools involved - the feet attach with screws, so if you choose to add feet, you also need to add a screwdriver.  The panels are easily paintable to coordinate with any d&eacute;cor.A terrific feature is that the cubes mix and match in infinite configurations.  You can add or subtract shelves, doors, feet, and drawers.  You can use them singly, side-by-side, or stacked.  The snap and clip assembly disassembles just as easily, so you can change your mind and reconfigure them to fit any space.As I was working on them, I was thinking \"5 stars all the way on this one!\"  However, when I opened the packet that accompanied the feet, labeled \"8 screws,\" I found only four.  Each foot requires two small, self-tapping screws.  It wasn't hard to scrounge up four more, and they aren't visible once the cube stands upright so the mismatch doesn't matter.  It wasn't a big deal, but it was disappointing.Assembly took about 75 minutes, from unpacking to finished cubes.  The second cube took about half the time of the first once I had the gist of the system (and I lost a few minutes dredging through my fastener odds `n' ends looking for extra screws).  The unit looks pretty nice considering the effort that went into it, although I'm on the fence about the price.

Here's my take on the LG robot vacuum.PROS:There's a lot to like about this vacuum.1.  Running after I had already cleaned with the Roomba 600, this LG robot vacuum cleaned up additional dust and pet hair.  It appears to have greater vacuum suction than the Roomba.2.  It's fun to watch the LG learn about the shape and barriers in the room, backing up and restarting.3.  The LED lights on the vacuum cover are nice and bright, and the voice tells you current settings and indicates some, although not all, problems.4.  The vacuum comes with a cleaning comb and extra brushes and filter.5.  The vacuum can be set for automatic running by using the included remote control.  Also, the remote control has a handy home on the charging unit so you don't have to look around for it.With all these nice features, you'd think I was thrilled, but the vacuum has problems as well.CONS:1.  The cameras on the vacuum view fabric skirt on lounge and easy chairs as barriers, so it does not clean under these chairs.  The Roomba does clean under chairs and all other furniture without getting stuck.2.  The vacuum is too tall to clear the underside of most of my furniture.  It gets stuck. Repeatedly.3.  The maximum time it has run without my attention is eight minutes.  Sometimes I understand why it has stopped; other times, not.  It plays a brief tune to let you know it has stopped, but if you have to be in the room with the vacuum to keep it going, it defeats the purpose of a robot.4.  The collection bin is small and fills up rapidly.5.  This vacuum does not like to run over cords and will stop.  Although the instructions clearly state to remove cords before vacuuming, with all the electronic stuff in most houses, this is not practical.  The Roomba simply runs over cords and keeps going, usually for about 1  hours without additional attention.Overall, the problems I've encountered with the LG HomBot outweigh its pluses.  Apparently, there is a version with a removeable mop plate for the bottom of the vacuum, but it was not included in the package, nor could I find it as an accessory on the LG website.If you have large rooms with not too many pieces of furniture, this might be an excellent choice, but for small apartments and houses, I'd suggest the Roomba instead.UPDATE:  July 1, 2013I'd love to love this vacuum because it clearly provides superior cleaning power when compared to the Roomba, but I'm frustrated with baby-sitting this machine.  Often it gets stuck or simply stops within two minutes of starting.  And, yes, I've timed it.  In addition, after carefully following the written instructions to set it for automatic starting, it has failed to start on its own 100% of the time.At the price charged for the HomBot, I would expect superior performance in robotic action.

Our previous sink strainer was a wire mesh type with a stainless steel rim.  The \"positive\" of that particular model is that the rim fit quite snugly onto the drain;  the \"negatives\" being that  1)  it required rather frequent debridement due to clogging issues, and  2)  the wire mesh was prone to breaking, causing scratches/pricks to hands and fingers whilst cleaning them.Secondary to the routine injuries caused by the broken mesh wires, our old sink strainers had become significantly stained, discolored, and were in dire need of being \"retired\".  While searching for replacement strainers on AMAZON.COM, my intention was to simply reorder two of the wire mesh strainers, unfortunately there was only ONE remaining in stock - and I required TWO.  As fate would have it, the same vendor offered this model for nearly the same price, so I thought I'd give it a try.  I'm so glad I did as this model is more solidly constructed with larger holes that promote faster drainage.  (The wire mesh model extended deeper into the drain, and somehow seemed to promote a \"scummy\" build-up on the mesh portion, thereby restricting the flow of water into the drain.)This NEW STAR INTERNATIONAL model (while not as deep as the mesh one) allows better water flow while still managing to capture food debris.  This new model is also much easier to keep clean and not likely to come apart and cause injury as the mesh one did.  In fact, the NEW STAR model has been in use at our house for about 3 months and both have retained their shiny stainless steel luster without any fuss, muss, or cleanser.The only minor caveat of this model might be the fact that it is slightly more \"mobile\" than the wire mesh version -meaning- it appears that the stainless steel ring portion of the strainer is perhaps just a \"hair\" thicker than the mesh model and as a result doesn't \"seat\" as securely into the top portion of the sink drain.  But this is the only \"minor flaw\" I can relate with the use of this particular strainer.  Other than that; no complaints.  We'll see how well it stands the test of time.  (My previous wire mesh model only lasted a couple of years.)I HIGHLY RECOMMENDED THIS NEW STAR INTERNATIONAL HEAVY-DUTY 18/10 SINK STRAINER.

I had (perhaps foolish) visions of putting whole apples and oranges through my juicer, no peeling etc. Well, I know now there will always be some prep with certain foods. So that fantasy aside, I was still hopeful that for most things I could just feed them and get the pulp one side and the juice the other.This works that way for some fruits and veggies like apples, strawberries, tomatoes, carrots. Others like citrus, pineapple, watermelon need to have the skin removed first which is time consuming.What I like:1. You get a lot of juice. Most of the pulp seems pretty dry for what I have tried so far which is: apples, oranges, carrots, tomatoes, strawberries, watermelon and pineapple.2. Dis-assembly and cleanup is fairly simple and quick. It says it's dishwasher safe, but I have so far just washed in warm soapy water right after juicing and everything cleans well except the filter.What I don't like:1. For most fruit and veggies you still have to prep somewhat. Most apples even have to be cut down since the ones on the market most of the time are too large for the spout.

It is a great idea (having the cracker well and the cheese slicer together in one mechanism). However, it sounds better than it is in reality. Here are a few things I noted after using it that I hadn't considered prior to purchase:1. The wire is slightly crooked. Although there is a paper included in the box that states they come this way intentionally and that it is easily adjusted, as soon as I adjust it (gently pull the bar out), it just goes right back in and the wire remains crooked. I think maybe the bar it is supposed to be tighter? At any rate, it remains just slanted enough to hit against wood on one end. It is still operational; it's just annoying having to pull slightly outward with each slice to manually readjust.2. The board is very small (serves no more than two people), which I knew, but I didn't realize the slicing/storage area for the cheese was so small. There is really no place to put the cheese once it is sliced because you need the area for the brick of cheese to lay (the one you are slicing). So the only option is to set it someplace else (like on a plate) until you are done, and then you can transfer it back to the board. However, if I have to use a separate plate for this purpose, it kind of defeats the purpose of having the one slicing/serving tray.3. Lastly, and probably the most annoying aspect of using this device: The cheese fragments get incredibly stuck inside the slicing area (under the wire)as you cut. This makes cleaning VERY difficult, and always makes me think twice about using it. The only way to really clean it well is to run a knife, toothpick, or some other \"crevice cleaning tool\" through the area as you wash it.For the above reasons, I am not very satisfied with this product, and would not repurchase or recommend to others. In this case, I feel like I only use the product because I bought it, not because I really like it.

It's not, but then again this versatile little brewer is half the price of their cheapest model.  Keurig did one or two things better, however I like this better.PLEASE NOTE::: Do not overfill the reservoir.  10 ounces is it and I now use a measuring cup to make sure that is what goes in.  I saw the extra space and figured I could get an extra ounce or two in there and while it will fit, the machine will not disperse all of the water.  It's almost as if it knows what 10 ounces is!  However, if you move the machine, say, to the back of the counter, the machine will then disperse the extra few ounces of scalding hot water and you will get 1st degree burns that will irritate for a day and a half or so.  Stick to the 10 ounces and if that just won't work for you, you really need to look at something different.Onto the review:I thought this was the perfect solution for my house....I like using ground coffee and my husband prefers the KCups. His Keurig died after 14 months and we have decided we didn't want to spend that much money again.  Also, someone had mentioned in a comment that if you registered you Keurig, they will take care of you even after a year.  They don't.I had read the reviews carefully on this machine and carefully measured my coffee.  I have not had any issues with the \"coffee explosion\" as some have put it. I have used just the regular grind Maxwell House. The taste of the coffee was perfect for me.  I never was able to achieve this flavor using ground coffee in the adapter for the Keurig.You do have to manually push the KCup into place in the holder until you hear a click.  It a bit cumbersome to do, but I figure eventually it will be second nature.  I got a little spoiled I guess with just dropping it into the Keurig and letting the close of the lid do all the work.I am going to admit, I have never liked the taste of KCups....that is until this machine.  I don't know what it is, but somehow this does something different than his Keurig and the coffee is quite tasty.The coffee was very hot, but not scalding.I also found that using filtered water (like a brita pitcher) removed all of the funky plastic taste.  Our water is very chlorinated and nothing stinks or tastes worse than hot chlorine in hot plastic with coffee grounds thrown into the mix.  This plastic taste almost made me return the unit.  Thankfully it dawned on me that in our 10 cup coffee maker there is a filter to filter our water.  Using the filtered water from the brita pitcher made all the difference in the taste of the coffee.Brewing takes a bit longer...about 4 minutes.  But the wait is worth it.  I do believe that is why my regular ground coffee tastes so much better from this machine as opposed to the Keurig.  The grounds have a chance to get a bit wet before the water really starts pouring.The brew light does go off before the coffee is actually done dripping. And unlike the drip or two of the Keurig, this one will continue for about a minute.What I would have loved to see is a refillable water tank.  I bought it knowing it did not have one and for $49 I don't expect that option, but I honestly miss that feature and would have paid more for this model if it had one. But this machine does so many things right that I can live with that.The only reason I took off a star was because of the overfilling issue.  It is a safety hazard.  I understand it is very clear in the directions not to overfill it, but I would rather Hamilton Beach design the machine so that the excess scalding hot water be dispersed somewhere else and not out the spout when you are trying to move the machine.PROS:-Very flexible brewing options-Nice looking machine-Doesn't take up much space at all-Is quite easy to clean-Makes a great cup of coffeeCONS:-There's no getting around the 10 ounce limit with out risk of injury.-I feel that the brew light goes out too early.  A good amount of coffee still comes out after that brew light goes out.All in all, for the price and versatility it is a great little machine.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "12 27, 2012", "summary": "Pleasantly surprised after owning a Keurig!"}

TheirBodum Stainless Steel Thermal Press Potis a work of art, and it makes really good coffee too.  This set of dishes is nice, and has some unique features, but it doesn't quite give me the joy that I expect from Bodum products, given the price.Overall they are very thin and lightweight.  The materials are all heat resistant, so they can be used in the oven.  But what these are really a better fit for is the microwave.  You really don't want to heat any plastics with your food in a microwave, but it's hard to find useful containers and lid combinations that aren't either plastic or somewhat bulky for a microwave.  (We're always putting an upside down salad plate over our Pyrex dishes, because we don't want to heat the plastic lids.)  This Hot Pot Set fits the bill - lightweight and heat-safe, both the dish and the lid.There are two dishes in the package, a one liter dish, and a 2.5 liter dish.  (A liter is a little larger than a quart.)  They fit inside each other.  The smaller dish is about 3-1/2 inches high by 6-1/2 across, and the larger is 4 inches high by 8-5/8 inches across.  You can't tell from the pictures, but the top edge is angled outward - the lid fits around that outward angled lip.The lids are silicone, and relatively thin, so very flexible.  The lid is heat resistant to 428 degrees F, so it can be used in the oven or the microwave - I think most people have missed that point - to reduce spattering.Borosilicate is the premium material for heat-resistant dishes.  At one time, the Pyrex products sold in the US were made from the material.  Now they have switched to cheaper glass, and while it generally does the job, it doesn't have the same resistance to thermal shock - Google on \"exploding Pyrex.\"  So you aren't just getting good looks here, there's some substance to them.So these are nice, fairly attractive and well designed, and offer function that's hard to find - but at a fairly steep price.", "overall": 3.0, "reviewTime": "01 18, 2012", "summary": "(3.5 stars) Well suited to microwave use, but design doesn't quite balance the price"}

I have a DeLonghi espresso maker, and it makes great espresso, but the milk frother on my machine is a joke. In looking for a better milk frothing solution, I tried Aerolatte machines, but I wasn't satisfied with their weak results either. Luckily, I stumbled onto this device.To be clear, I was seeking out very thick, creamy, meringue-like froth. My espresso machine and the Aerolatte made foam with bubbles far too large to support this type of froth, so I was skeptical when I saw that this machine advertised \"meringue-like frother,\" yet works on pretty much the same principle as an Aerolatte frother. Nevertheless, I decided to try it out, and on its first run, it gave me exactly what I was looking for: mounds of soft, pillowy forthed milk that looked more like whipped cream or meringue. I was also left with just enough steamed milk at the bottom of the pitcher to make my cappuccino.Making frothed milk with this machine couldn't be easier: add cold milk, put on the lid, and press a button. A few minutes later, the machine automatically shuts down when it's done. As I said, you're left with mounds of perfect frothed milk, and just enough steamed milk to finish your drink. The pitcher has a nonstick surface, so cleanup is pretty simple and doens't take much time.My only complaint is that it's a bit difficult to remove the frothing disk from the bottom of the pitcher, and the instructions don't provide any guidance or tips. My technique is to reach down underneath the disk and just pry up one side until it pops off. The disk is quite firmly connected to the pitcher and is made of thin plastic, so it doesn't seem like the best design. Like a previous reviewer, I was initially scared that I might break the disk, but it hasn't happened yet, so maybe it's more rugged than it looks. There's a little tab that sticks up from the center of each disk--it looks like it's for gripping the disk, but I didn't have any luck removing it that way. Another complaint is that the disk-mounting assembly sticking up at the bottom center of the pitcher is like a little needle! I got a pretty bad poke when figuring out how to attach and remove the disks, and, again, I didn't see any warning in the instruction book.Overall, however, these are very minor complaints, and I'm more than satisfied with this unit.

While volume level is subjective, I have to say that this does not even come close to what I would call quiet, even for an air conditioner. I replaced a 5 year old Samsung unit that had the main board go out. I grew accustomed to the sound of that A/C as being at a comfortable, droning level that blocked outside noise and actually helped me sleep. This one has an entirely different noise.There are two types of noise a window A/C makes. One is the noise of the compressor, which this unit does a great job of isolating - the compressor noise is almost non-existent.The other is the noise of the fan. This unit's fan is louder than any fan (A/C or otherwise) I've ever had in my room. It's hard to describe - a mix of a loud whoosh with a little bit of roar thrown in. I slept better the previous 3 nights at 80 degrees with my Vornado fan than I did last night at 70 with this A/C.Pros:The air that comes out is ice cold.Takes very little time to start blowing above referenced ice cold air.Keeps my 156 sq ft bedroom nice and cool.Easy to install due to compact size (I installed it in a slider window - far from a typical installation).Did a great job reducing humidity in the air.Compressor is quiet with no loud noise when it kicks on or off.Cons:Much louder than reviews led me to believe (on both high and low settings).Very weird directional vents that cannot point lower than horizontal (I like to have cool air blowing right at me, and my window is higher than my bed)In the end, I will say that I am mostly satisfied. I would probably buy this unit again given the price to feature ratio.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "06 28, 2012", "summary": "Not as quiet as the other reviewers suggest"}

This is not a heavy-duty industrial slicer and cannot be compared to a Hobart or Berkel.  If you are wanting a slicer for more industrious purposes then one of the mentioned thousand plus dollar slicers are perfect.  But this one was less than one hundred dollars and is perfect for small jobs.The first thing I like is the fact that it is small enough to fit under our counter, making it very convenient to get out.  Convenience is a huge factor.  If it takes longer to get the slicer out and set up than it would to use a knife then it wouldn't make sense to use--believe it or not this happens a lot with kitchen appliances.I will concede that there are some plastic parts on the appliance (there's more metal than plastic), but in my opinion that is not a detriment to this appliance because most will not be using it in a deli or butcher shop.  A few gears are made of plastic, etc., but given the intended application of this appliance I feel that's okay.  I've had no stripping of gears or broken pieces as of yet and I've been using the machine for nearly six months.  Just make sure you keep the plastic blade gear lubricated.  Though not USDA approved, an inert petroleum jelly like Vasoline will work fine.I never force anything through the blade and by doing that I end up with uniform cuts.  I'm sure Chef's Choice did not engineer the appliance to perform well using Hulk-like strength to muscle food stuffs through.  If you don't gently push the food though the cuts are un-uniform and wavy looking.  I would recommend gentility when slicing.  Remember, you're not working at a deli or butcher shop cutting hundreds of pounds of meat a day.I've not had any problems using the serrated blade that came with the appliance, but I do like the way the non-serrated blade cuts (bought extra).  I prefer the non-serrated blade, but that doesn't mean you'll be disappointed by the serrated blade.Clean up is easy.  Everything that needs to be disinfected disassembles easily.When I cut jerky, or any meat, I leave the meat mildly frozen.  It will become obvious if you try to cut fresh meat.  If the meat is too soft the cut uniformity will not be there.I strongly recommend the product.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "09 25, 2012", "summary": "Great for Slicing Jerky"}

And that was the last I got out of it. It never turned back on.The returns process through the manufacturer was very simple, though UPS has yet to come pick up the old machine.The machine that actually works is not too bad. It grinds alright, but produces quite a bit of coffee bean dust, which finds its way easily into the bottom of our coffee pot. I am sure a paper filter would solve this problem, but we use a metal re-usable filter, so we'll have to deal with it.It is LOUD. I don't use it after 8pm because I feel bad for the upstairs neighbor. I mean, it's not THAT loud, but it's loud at night when people are tying to sleep, ya know? I also don't use it in the morning. Same problem.I do like the container that the ground coffee deposits into. It's very well contained... until you open it, and coffee dust spills on your counter. Just open it over the sink and you'll be fine. But otherwise, while it's grinding nothing escapes, and I leave the unused ground coffee in the container for a few days and it seems to stay fairly fresh.The machine is about twice the size I think is necessary for the average person or couple, but if you're going to make plenty of coffee and need to grind plenty of beans, this machine's capacity is great.

The looks are really nice and good for display during small parties.  I have a couple of Bella products that I own and have been very pleased with the results.  I think that these products are good looking and functional.  For me, Bella works really well for entertaining.  I am not affiliated to the company, I just like the products.I made chicken wings for a crowd with three different sauces then put them in these cookers at a low temperature.  Each 2.5 qt cooker is able to fit up to 2 dozen chicken wings (wings and drumettes).  The wings stayed warm for several hours without a problem.  I placed signs with the different sauces and everyone was really impressed.  I really like how the lids can be placed in the back and it's easy to serve with one hand (which is really handy when your other hand is holding a plate) Also, be sure to let people know that the cookers are hot on the outside (sometimes really hot).As for the design itself, the cooker has a simple dial on the front with a small indentation that points at the low, high, warm setting.  It is kind of hard to see it especially if the lights are a little dim.  The base of the cooker is not heavy at all is made mostly of plastic.  They attach to each other - there's a really good video from another reviewer that shows this part very well.  And lastly, for storage purposes (stack on top of each other) dimensions are 10&#34; front length, 11.5&#34; depth (including knob), and 21.5&#34; high if the lid is upside down.Very good product but my only concern is the cord.  It's a unique design.  Though cords are really tough and hard to ruin, I wonder if there's a way to replace it.  Overall, I am satisfied with the cookers and hope to use them a lot.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "01 3, 2014", "summary": "Great cookers, love the looks"}

It's a nifty little product, but unfortunately it's just too small.  It certainly won't settle over a mixing bowl or jug, so you'll find yourself having to hold this in one hand whilst breaking the egg in the other.  I'm certainly not very good at doing that.  The product could really have done with a long handle or something of the sort.  In addition, this product does not make separating the yolk from egg white a very quick process.  I believe the reason may be because the holes are too small-egg white takes forever to drip through into the container below.  Impatience only lead to the yolk breaking and spilling through the holes.  As a final note, a large egg barely fits into the indention, and if you're slightly off by an inch or so when breaking the egg into this gadget, you might end up with egg anywhere but where you wanted it.Whilst it's easy to clean and looks cute, there's not much else going for this product.

It's a very attractive and functional set that would fill the basic cutting and chopping needs of most non-professional cooks - especially beginners.  I enjoy the way the handles are balanced and shaped though I must admit that when I actually use the knives the ergonomics aren't quite right.  It's almost as if the shape of the handles were made to feel good when holding the knives rather for actually using them.  It's not that they are \"wrong\" so much as they aren't quite \"right\".I've been using Wustof knives for years.  As they are another German knife manufacturer I thought they'd be a great comparison to this set.  The first thing to note is that stamped on these knives are the elements that were used in forging the steel.  My Wustof set states:  X50 Cr MO 15 - the Chef's knives read:  X50 Cr MO V 15 - thus they are composed of the same basic elements.  The Chef's Toolbox set also has an element called Vanadium added to the steel which should lend corrosion resistance to the blades as that element is corrosion resistant to alkalis, sulphuric acid, hydrochloric acid, and salt water.Piece for piece, the Chef's Tool knives are much heavier than their Wustof equivalent.  For example, the Chef's Toolbox bread knife weighs 50% more (6 ounces) than the Wustof bread knife (4 ounces).  The blades are thicker and I find the edges to be a lot less sharp.  In other words, the cutting edges of these knives are thicker than what I'm used to using and are thus less sharp than the edge I can get on my Wustof knives.  Granted, comparing these knives to Wustof knives is a bit like comparing a Toyota to a BMW.  Both are great brands but one of them delivers a level of performance that is measurably superior to the other (and of course has a much higher cost).  My favorite knives in this set are the 2 fusion wave knives.  In fact, the smaller one in the set is likely going to become one of the most frequently used knives in my kitchen as it is wonderfully versatile.  I feel like I exert a bit more effort when using this knife as opposed to some of the others in my knife block.  Its size, shape and balance are such a delight to me that I'm considering taking it in to a professional grinder to have a new edge put on it to see what I can make it do if it were as sharp as the tools I'm accustomed to using.For the money, this set is a great option.  Serious cooks and chefs may want to look for an alternative, but the Chef's Toolbox set would more than meet the needs of the average modern American householder.  Considering the fact that most high-quality knives can easily cost upwards of $150 EACH, I feel that this set presents a very economical opportunity to purchase a good quality knife set that not only performs well but should last a lifetime and compliment most any kitchen decor in the process.  If purchasing this set, you may also want to consider purchasing a stand alone knife sharpening tool as this set does not include a sharpening steel nor does it provide space for one to be added to the block.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "07 1, 2011", "summary": "These would make a great gift as they are an attractive and high-quality set."}

The pieces are substantial, well constructed with quality materials, and are non stick.  With this set come the usual pieces as described on the listing page.  In addition to the nine pieces, however, there is a two piece bakeware bonus with this set. These baking \"sheets\" are terrific, with raised sides to keep items from slipping off and built on silicone handles for easier handling and lifting.Having an older Circulon set of bakeware ( made by the same company) I can see that the pieces are similar though these seem a little heavier. The three quart sauce pan and the 10 inch skillet weigh over two pounds. Fill them with food and the weight can be daunting. Mrs. Spudman recently had shoulder surgery, so I've been doing all the lifting from stovetop to countertop, resting the hot pans on wooden cutting boards.You can use metal with these pieces, but we prefer to use wood or plastic utensils.  We also try to be careful when storing the pieces in a cabinet, using kitchen towels to separate each piece. Even with the care we take, eventually the pieces suffer scratches on the outside.This is our second experience with the Autograph 2 coating, and it holds up very well. On the Anolon site which has lots of good advice and recipes, the user is advised not to use cooking spray on the nonstick surface and not to cook at high heat. (500 degrees plus) We also never put any of the cookware in our dishwasher, but wash with warm soapy water and a kitchen sponge. Never steel wool!Other thoughts:We like the comfortable handles on this cookware, the feel, sturdiness and the shape of them.

{"reviewerID": "A2TCHXH4SIN2OF", "asin": "B00HG84YQU", "reviewerName": "Severian \"Severian\"", "helpful": [22, 22], "unixReviewTime": 1395964800, "reviewText": "We had just bought a Panasonic iron, model NI-W810CS, 8 months before getting this TFAL in the Vine program. I'll compare the two in this review, and also comment on the TFAL in regards to its standalone merits.Short Review: Pointy front edge and large reservoir are pros. The light weight and long cord can be pros or cons depending on your needs, as can the complex and comprehensive de-calcing system. Cons include the need to clean and decalc the iron once per month (at least if you take the instructions seriously) and the idiotic \"pictorial only\" manual, which will leave you confused and squinty-eyed. Biggest liability is the entirely too vigorous steam system, which often sprays water out, drips from the front plate holes, and often makes the iron sound like Thomas the Tank Engine. The Panasonic competitor is generally more successful across the board and though it costs more, the difference in price is not enough to favor the TFAL in my opinion.Full Details:Iron Shape -- TFAL has point front, Pana is more or less symmetrical in shape, so the front is about as pointy as the rear of the face plate. This makes it easier to use TFAL to iron nooks and crannies in clothing, but makes it easier to reverse directions quickly with the Pana. All in all, I found the more traditional TFAL shape to be more useful.Water Capacity -- TFAL is larger in capacity (9 oz vs 6.75 oz) and is much easier to fill, as the port is larger and can even be put directly under a tap faucet. The Pana is more old school, with a tiny port, complete with a flimsy cover that is just waiting to break off at the first mishap. Clear win for TFAL here.Weight -- To get wrinkles out, pressure has to come from somwhere. Pana is heavier, TFAL lighter. Hence, TFAL is less fatiguing in theory, but you will have to press down more to get the fabric smooth. Choose your poison. I liked the weight of the Pana more myself, but there is no clear answer as to which is best.Cords -- TFAL has 12 ft, Pana about 9 feet. Both cords manuever freely around 360 degrees, neither retracts. A long cord can be good or bad, depending on your specific ironing needs. My ironing board is really close to the outlet, so I like the Pana.DeCalcinating -- Panasonic mysteriously just claims they have one on the 810. They don't go into detail, and you the user don't have to do anything. It just works. Or does it? No idea, only had the iron for 10 months, and NYC has soft water, so it is not much of a workout for decalcing methods. TFAL in comparison has some wand gadget in the middle of the reservoir that needs to be cleaned separately once per month, and then cleaned again in the separate once per month iron cleaning. This seems like a bit of work for the user, and frankly, I don't think I am going to do it very often or at all. Will my TFAL iron calc up in no time? No idea. If I had hard water, I think I would go with the TFAL and follow the regimen, but for soft water and / or lazy ironers, the possible ineffectual though low effort Pana approach may have more merit. I personally think two different cleaning protocols once per month is rather excessive for a low cost appliance, but you may disagree. If the instructions were clearer, this would have been a neutral point for me, but see below for why this protocol and the lame instructions interacted to give a victory to Pana.Manual -- Pana has a two page or so written manual with small print, and a few diagrams that is really nothing exceptional. Yet everything is clear enough. TFAL, either fearing an uptick in illiteracy and / or wanting to save money on localization costs of the manual around the world, has all features and instructions in minuscule pictograms that had me straining my eyes to see them. Even worse, TFAL had numerous instances of two pictures that look very much alike next to each other, one of which has an X through it (meaning \"don't do this!!\") and another with a smiley face (\"yes, do this!\") Good luck figuring out what you're supposed to do unless you're a professional sniper! Plus the pictograms are bundled into lengthy sequences - the monthly cleaning has roughly 17 steps! It's like the Common Core Curriculum approach to iron use and maintenance... This whole concept struck me as annoying and misguided, but showed how even a mediocre manual using old fashioned words can still be a better solution than hieroglyphic innovations for consumer products.Steam -- Pana is 1500 watts, TFAL more than 1700. All my ironing was on the \"cotton\" setting for both units, i.e. near the max. The two irons are fairly evenly matched in quality of results produced despite the wattage difference. However, the real issue is the TFAL's \"Raging Bull\" steam system. The auto steam system has 4 settings plus off, and only on setting 2 is adequate steam produced with only occasional water emission. Setting 1 is virtually no leaks, but not much usable steam, and settings 3 & 4 produce a lot of leaks, plus water bubbling out through the faceplate. If you turn autosteam off and try to control the steam using manual bursts, you almost always get water coming out. Pana in comparison almost never has water leaks, even on highest autosteam and plenty of manual bursts. Maybe the lower wattage works in Pana's favor? Not sure, but in any case any possible benefit from more powerful TFAL steam is offset by the frequent leaks and lack of control in TFAL. Big win for the Pana.Common Features: Both units had useful auto off systems that vary shut off time based on position of iron. Nice idea, well implemented in both. Both irons took the same time to heat up, and as mentioned earlier, produced usable ironing results that were comparable. No flaws or breakages, build quality appears similar for both. Both have a one year warranty. The main points of distinction between the two models are summarized above.Bottom Line: The more precise steam control of the Pana makes it more useful for me. The TFAL has a few comparative strengths, but the undisciplined steam is a big issue for me. If the TFAL was a lot cheaper, I might forgive this, but as of this writing, the TFAL costs 20% less on Amazon, which to me is not enough of a differential to offset an annoying flaw. Panasonic for the win for me, and unless you are confident that my particular over-steaming TFAL was a lemon, you will probably be better advised to go for the Panasonic as well. (Unless the price for TFAL falls a lot, and / or you worry about calcination and think the TFAL overkill approach sounds like something you need.)", "overall": 3.0, "reviewTime": "03 28, 2014", "summary": "Steamy Non-Romance"}

When you take into consideration the 16 coffee bean blends, plus several special release blends; add an infinite variety of water-to-bean ratios; an infinite variety of milk proportions and foam thicknesses--well, it provokes excitement each time you turn it on.It is so easy to use and so easy to clean!  But, I have to say, that if the choice of coffee was poor or the quality of the coffee was less than superb, \"easy\" would have no bearing on how well we liked this machine.You can use the machine with or without adding milk.  And the milk container can detach and be stored in the frig.  The machine is programmed to create espresso and lungo portions, plus you can re-program it easily to create anything in between.  When not using the milk frother, you will be extremely happy with the crema:  It is thick, rich and luxurious.This is our second Nespresso machine:  We also have a CitiZ in a \"60's\" (kind of old-fashioned) white color to match the style of our kitchen,Citiz in Creamy White.  We still use it, because very often we don't feel the need to add milk and just crave an espresso shot.  We keep both machines on the kitchen counters.  They do not look well together.  We've left the CitiZ in its long-time, more prominent position because its older look lends charm to the kitchen.  The Lattissima is tucked in a corner and while it is \"stylish\" it is also not conspicuous.  Our Lattissima machine is white (and black); the white matches KitchenAide and Cuisinart white.I also have aGaggia for Illy Espresso Machine, and compared to this Lattissima machine, it is clumsy looking, clumsy in the way it froths milk and difficult and time-consuming to clean the frothing wand.The Lattissima is easy to learn how to use.  We've never had any issues with either of the Nespresso machines.  Customer Service is always helpful and cheerful.  Periodically someone will call and ask if all is well with our machines and do we have any questions.  There is a great, interesting, full-color magazine produced by Nespresso also. It is available online or hard copy through the mail.We buy our capsules from Nespresso online.  We order a four-five month supply at a time to maximize the value of their flat-rate shipping charge.  They have never messed up an order.  Shipping is very quick.  Of course, we have our favorite blends, but we are fond of all the blends and always try to keep all 16+ blends on hand.The only fault I can think of--and it's so minor, I feel that I'm clutching at straws in mentioning it:  There are always a few straggling drips of coffee after the brewing ends.  But because you need to have some kind of cup available to catch the water residue involved in the cleaning process, it's no big deal to switch out your coffee cup for your cleaning cup.  We didn't have to search too hard to find a little cup that (kind of) matched the machine, and that's what we routinely keep positioned under the brewer spout when not actually brewing.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "08 20, 2012", "summary": "Terrific coffee flavor; endless possibilities; small and easy!"}

Everything is easily removable, including the filter, which when rinsed under cold water, removes any dirt. You may have to dump out any dirt after each use because the container is rather small, especially if you vacuum often, but because you can actually see how much dirt has been collected due to it being clear, you know for certain when you have to do it.If I could, I would give this vacuum 4.5 stars simply because I thought it was a little pricey for a vacuum that has no extensions, like a pipe to clean the sofas.

The dials are clearly marked and the toasting settings are easy to figure out...so there's no guessing. I love that a timer displays to let you know how long until your toast is done. There are also an additional settings/buttons if your item is frozen or if it's a bagel.I've also used the oven setting to reheat items. Very satisfied with that as well. There are three rack positions for broiling, toasting and baking. It's a well built kitchen appliance and I don't regret rearranging my counter to accommodate the toaster oven.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "09 22, 2011", "summary": "Very Pleased!"}

They were absolutely filthy.  In fact, I was about to rip them up and live on the bare concrete floor - that's how bad they truly were.  I thought they were hopeless because we had used the Rug Doctor machine on them a couple of times and it had not done much good.Enter the Hoover SteamVac with Clean Surge!  Using the Hoover Deep Cleansing shampoo, I began to use the SteamVac exactly as prescribed in the user manual.  Two wet strokes (one forward, one backward - SLOWLY), and two dry strokes (same thing, but without holding the shampoo trigger), I was astonished to watch my carpets become cleaner and cleaner as I worked my way around the room.  As the user manual suggested, I used double the amount of shampoo because I did not pretreat the spots.  (What was the use?  The entire carpet was black!)The carpet dried very quickly, and as it dried, the color became lighter and brighter.  Where were those horrible black spots that had been on there for years?  GONE!  And our cat's accidents?  Gone as well - with no lingering odor!Even weeks after the first cleaning, there is NO CAT SMELL!!!  That in itself is a miracle.  I cannot believe that we are living in the same house, quite truthfully.  I never imagined that a fairly inexpensive carpet shampooer could do such an incredible job.  I could not be happier.  I am no longer embarrassed to have friends walk in my front door.  In fact, one of my friends asked if we had gotten new carpeting.  She could not believe that this carpet was nearly 15 years old.True, it does require making multiple trips to the sink to fill and dump the filthy water.  Believe me, that's a small price to pay to have my carpets looking so good again!  I am kicking myself for waiting so long to purchase this machine.  I can't imagine anything ever working any better than this does.

The best part of this is the extra long handle and the pivoting base. When you pull down the base pivots forward and when you pull back the crushed can on the based that is turned and allows the can to fall out without having to pull it out. Put a trash can under it and they fall in. I put mine in a stairwell to the basement and put a hole though the step that has a large plastic pipe through it just under the base. They fall in the pipe and into the basement where a can is waiting out of site. I know other reviewers were afraid of this being plastic.

My old Cuisinart model made excellent coffee, and was still going strong after ten years, but as a lot of people know, water condensed on the lid of these older models, and when the lid was opened it would dribbled down the back.  I put a towel down to collect the drips, but after ten years I decided to replace the unit.I'm glad I did.This is the same high-quality coffee maker as my old one, but now the condensed water on the lid has a place to go, and the other new/improved features are nice too.  I love the large 14-cup capacity when needed.  I also love how classy this coffee maker looks on my kitchen counter.  But more important than just about anything, the water heats to the right temperature for proper brewing - mine measures 200 degrees at the shower head - and the resulting coffee in the carafe is HOT.I use freshly roasted whole beans, weigh them whole (9-11 g/per 6-oz water - aka the \"Golden Ratio\"), and then grind them in a burr grinder right before brewing the coffee.  I adjust the size of the grind to make sure that every pot of coffee, regardless of the size, meets the coffee geeks' \"eight-minute rule\" for drip coffee - and that rule is that hot water never spends more than eight minutes on/dripping through the ground coffee.  Any time less than six minutes and flavor is left behind, and any time more than eight minutes will over-extract and dissolve unwanted flavor compounds that render the coffee bitter.  It takes some testing to calibrate the grind size to the amount of water to ensure the eight-minute rule (more water the bigger the particle size and vice versa) but it's well worth the effort.  With the application of this simple science - and using a burr, NOT a blade grinder - you'll get all the flavor the so-called high-tech automatic drip makers promise to deliver, but at a fraction of the cost.  You don't need a Technivorm or a Bonavita to do this.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "12 7, 2013", "summary": "Nothing but the best ~ ~ ~ ~ *"}

After 2 uses, we got rid of it - horrible to clean and the waffles weren't that good. We knew we wanted another waffle maker, but there were a million choices and they were fairly expensive, so we put it off. Finally, I decided to get my partner one for her birthday because she was always talking about wanting to make them at home.I am a research queen, and after doing extensive searching, I decided on this one. I am so glad I did, and it is beyond worth the money.Ease of use: I pretty much hate cooking, and I can (and like) using this machine! You simply plug it in, wait a few minutes, and it's ready to go. After putting the batter in, you close and twist, and leave it for a few minutes. This leaves time to finish doing the dishes, or making the bacon, while not having to worry. I've found that I perfer to leave my waffle in there another 1-2 minutes after the beep, for a more crispier texture. When it's done, the waffle just comes right out - you can use your fingers or a fork and it just lifts right not - NO STICKING!Clean-up: It comes with a drip pan, which is a nice bonus, but we hardly ever need it. We might spill a bit over after the first pour, but after that we get used to it and the batter stays inside like it's supposed to. After we are done and it cools off, we just wipe the inside down with a little soapy water, but we actually don't see any residue or dirt - the waffle really comes out that smoothly.Design: Yes, it's a big big, but not as big as some. The handle folding in was worth the extra bit of money. It cleans well and there are very few buttons, so it's super simple.We are super happy with this purchase, and would not hesitate to buy it again!", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "04 29, 2014", "summary": "Breakfast will never be the same!"}

I do a fair bit of travel by car and I love hot coffee, tea and even lattes. I have a Nespresso machine and lately have been making my own lattes at home as opposed to going to Starbucks every morning (more than once a day sometimes!) With my Nespresso I can make just as good - if not better - a latte than I get at Starbucks for less than half the cost. The problem is how to carry an extra large coffee, tea or latte with me to work or on the road. Normal mugs hold about 16oz (grande in starbucks speak) and thermos makes a great 16oz in this same line. This product holds 24oz of any liquid and keeps it hot for about 4-5 hours. (at least for me).Pros:Sturdy, metal container, very well made. Sleek appearance, looks great! Love the midnight metallic blue.The screw on & flip top cap is one of the best I have seen. Easy to clean, doesn't need to be taken apart, etc.. just wash / scrub it with a brush or sponge. it's spring loaded & has a little metal retainer that you can snap shut for extra holding power. When you want a drink, you just press the button - the lid pops back (and stays back) and you take a sip from the well designed cap.I think the thermos holds a little more than 24oz which allows you to have a true 3 cups with a little room so you don't have to worry about overfilling. As long as you don't overfill, it's absolutely leakproof. I have inverted it, shaken it, and toss it in the air - no leaks. If you do overfill, the amount that you overfill will flood the cap and that can leak - so just to be clear - don't overfill.Cons:It's a little heavy but it's metal so what do you expect?While it says it keeps hot drinks hot for 12 hours, I found my coffee just &#34;very warm&#34; after 5 hours but I had ben drinking from it off and on a lot, and leaving the flip top back.

I will explain the pros and cons of this juicer/press, as well as how it stacks up against the Jack Lalanne Power Juicer, and against the Vitamix.A quick overview, is that this juicer does a good job with all but the hardest vegees, and all but the softest fruits, like bananas (unless you want to make sorbet). The cleanup is not really that bad, especially if you're used to cleaning the mesh screens of other juicers. Mesh screens do not clean easily, but after some practice you develop a knack for it.Before I get into the pros and cons, I will say that this makes pulpy juice and juicy pulp. To some, that may be a negative thing. But I love to eat the wet pulp, it taste like an indulgent treat to me. And I've always liked my juice with pulp in it. Basically, the machine does a good (but not great) job of separating pulp and juice. If you're going to throw away your pulp, you'd be wasting a lot of good stuff!Ok, first I'll give detailed info on the cons:The literature claims this will do carrots, but by the time you get a miniscule amount of juice after cleaning and cutting your carrot up into small pieces, and running the machine forward, then backward several times to free up jams, you probably could've eaten three carrots. This definitely falls way short of both my Power Juicer and my Vitamix. My Power Juicer will juice five pounds of carrots in the time it took me to juice a single carrot in this thing. And my Vitamix of course will pulverize carrots in no time. So for carrots I will stick with one of those two machines, depending upon whether I want just the juice (Power Juicer) or the juice with pulp (Vitamix).I have two other cons, but they are fairly minor complaints. First, the clear container that houses the yellow trimmed mesh basket is not designed to my liking. You have to let it air dry, as the bottom has a semi closed in area that cannot be accessed for drying purposes. This means I have to let it sit our for a long time before putting it away, as I do not like damp crevices to sit where mold and/or bacteria can build up. I can see no other way to design it though, to allow pulp and juice to have separate exit points. My last issue is with the weight of the unit. The base alone is 12 lbs, and the handle is not very ergonomic for carrying. When you pick it up by the handle the weight of it makes the whole thing want to topple forward. It definitely takes two hands to carry it. But maybe the weight of the unit speaks for it's sturdiness. So no star taken away for that really, it's just a minor inconvenience.Ok, now for the pros:First, it's surprisingly quiet, I can hold a conversation in a normal tone of voice while this is running. I love this juicer for the things my Power Juicer doesn't do well. I'm mainly talking about softer fruits like citrus and kiwis, this does a bang up job on those. And the pulp is really tasty too (especially on the kiwis). Also, I am pleasantly surprised that I have not gotten any jams at all in the pulp chute, which surprised me considering it's small size. I LOVE the fact that you can make frozen sorbet with soft frozen fruits like bananas (That's the only way you can do bananas in this machine). As far as juice extraction, it's not as good as my Power juicer, but fairly close. But as as I said, I do enjoy eating the wet pulp. (You need to core your apples first if you don't want to eat seedy pulp).Here are some of my yields:One 12 oz bag of cranberries and one medium grapefruit yielded 14 oz. juice. Add one packet of stevia, and this is really yummy!On another batch, I used 1.5 lb red grapes, 3 apples, and 2 kiwis. It filled the entire 32 oz container to the top.Of all the things I like about this juicer, I would have to say my favorite is the way it does apples. I did not have any problems at all with the apples getting a little jammed, as other uses have experienced. As far as the apple juice goes, since this is a 'press', not a centrifugal juicer, it makes the apple juice taste a little thicker and richer than what I'm used to with my power juicer. I love that because it reminds me of some of the farm stands where I grew up in the midwest where we could get fresh cider each fall! I can't wait to heat some this evening and add a little cinnamon to it!All in all, I like this juice press. If I had to pick only one of my machines to keep (between this, my power juicer, and my vitamix), it would be my Vitamix because it's more versatile and can literally handle Everything I put into it. Nonetheless, this is a decent machine. I did receive it free in exchange for my honest review, so I feel it's only fair to add that I think the price is a little high. I would not pay $199 for it.", "overall": 3.0, "reviewTime": "10 26, 2013", "summary": "Great for Apples, Useless for Carrots"}
