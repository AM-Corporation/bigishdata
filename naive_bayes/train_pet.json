It was a few dollars less than a better reviewed one, so I went for it.  If it's stainless and doesn't leak, what's not to like?Well for one thing, the \"three quart\" bowl doesn't hold three quarts.  Right out of the box I noticed it looked small, so I verified first that Amazon sent me the right one.  A sticker on the bottom confirmed it was the three quart model.  Now perplexed, I got out my measuring bowls and poured two quarts of water into it.  It filled to a little less than about one inch below the brim.  Even though I knew what would happen, I placed it in the sink and poured in another quart.  As expected it overflowed.  It WAY overflowed.  I couldn't believe it was so much smaller than advertised, so I repeated the process and got the same result.  You could perhaps get 2 1/2 quarts in the thing if you filled it to the point where it was about to overflow.As others have said the bowl is most definitely not heavy duty.  It's actually fairly thin.  I can also confirm that, again as others have reported, the label inside is absurdly difficult to clean off (no, vinegar doesn't work - maybe if you soaked it for longer than I have patience for).  Of course, a goo gone type product works, but should you really need to do that?If I had to do it again I'd spend a few dollars more to get something that (a) holds the advertised volume, (b) is more substantial in terms of thickness and weight, and (c) doesn't cause aggravation in trying to remove a silly label.You might want to pass on this one.

Dogs will eat just about anything, except for broccoli and carrots with my baby Jilly, and to get some item when you are paying mostly for either package design or brand name isn't something I buy into being that stuff impresses me, not her.  That being said I did like this product and more importantly Jilly loved it.  These have the same X shape as a dentastix, so I have to assume it would help getting rid of some plaque buildup, although there are no claims on the package.  The cinnamon and spice flavor was potent enough that I could smell it when I opened the package, which I liked, being I knew what she is getting.  And even though the flavor might be more for me than for Jilly, it sure is an improvement over liver flavors etc.Compared to similar products this was harder and took her more time to eat, which I liked.  It took her about 8-10 minutes and a lot of similar type products she eats in just a few minutes.  All that being said, I really did enjoy the product for what it was, but I am not so sure about any weight loss or health benefits.  The L-Carnitine proudly displayed on the front of the package, right next to the antioxidants came off as something like lycopene does for people.  Sure it's good for you and you should eat more of it but when you do do you honestly notice a difference in the way you feel?  As to the weight loss aspects, my dog is only about 8 months old and she's normal weight, but a bit husky being she's a lab. She has some small milk dud sized treats that are her absolute favorites that are 3 calories each and a handful would have less calories than this bone, if weight was an issue and Jilly prefers a natural bone (real bone not rawhide) and it takes her a LONG time to eat and I can't believe the amount of calories she gets per preserving is more than 92.Basically, for what it is it's a very good product, that being said there are most likely better options out there if you aren't willing to spend money on the nice smell and nice packaging.

My floor keeps getting little clay spots which are hard to get off when a bit of clay tidy cat gets stepped on. Yuck. Pine doesn't grind in, it just sweeps right up.CONS:1) Tracks and gets kicked out of the litter box very easily.

She has been determined to pull and is very strong, pulling me down the street every time I walk her. I was apprehensive purchasing this harness as I have tried everything available. I was absolutely amazed the first time I put it on her she walked with me, still pulling but very gently, about 1/10th of what she used to pull. She is so strong that she tripped me while walking with a gentle leader and pulled me down the sidewalk on my stomach until I got control. This harness is amazing. After just 5 uses she no longer pulls and walks with me as this harness holds her breast and stops her in her tracks if she tries to pull. I especially like the very thick padded portion which goes under her legs which is not uncomfortable to her and does not scar her skin as Dobies are very prone to skin problems. She tolerates this very well where with the gentle leader she used to stop every 500 feet or so to try to get it off of her snout. Great product. The only minor complaint I have is the instructions on the package it comes in are hard to follow because they are so small.

When we attached all the wheels and rolled the stroller around the driveway, the front wheels just hopped up and down, and the left wheel looked like it was going to fall off. It looked that way because of the pipes that were bent inward.  The front wheels attached fine but when you rolled the stroller they wobbled and jumped around so much that the stroller was hard to push. The front frame pipes where the front wheels attach are really bent inward - both at different angles. On closer examination, it looks like the pipes where not attached to the main frame correctly, at least that is what we are assuming. It looks like the bend should have been facing outwards and not inwards, both at different angles.The back wheels worked great and the handle was padded with 2 lock positions.The actual stroller is a lovely blue color and the netting very well sewn in with velcro to hold the screens up. I did notice the front seam was straining around the front of the seat base frame - the seam is sewn up the middle. The stitches were pulling and the thread (seam) holes enlarged enough to see light through. The cloth could eventually rip from the constant strain in that area. The cover was very tight on the bottom.Also, the locks on the front wheels were not the ones in the instruction booklet that came with the stroller. These were black half moons and pushed into place instead of the red slide button shown to lock the front wheels in the instruction booklet. The instruction booklet also says this stroller is for pets up to 145 pounds but the package says the stroller is for pets up to 150 pounds. I don't know  why the package and instruction booklet doesn't match.Other than those defects the stroller was nice and roomy and our dog would really have enjoyed taking a ride. I am returning this stoller because of the defects and ordering another one. I really like Pet Gear and have quite a few of their products.

I found that at first when I started it it was really loud, but after a couple of minutes it became almost silent (I think the air had to be purged and propeller locked in, try shaking them a little and putting your hand over the back part where the water gets sucked in to quiet them down when you first get them up and running). Now when I turn them off and on during water changes the initial loud noise is gone and they start up perfectly. If I had saltwater tanks and were using them with a wave maker I probably would worry and instead spend a little more and buy the old maxijets with the aftermarket conversion kits or Hydors. But for my clown loach tank they are perfect, so perfect that I have decided to buy another one! Now, after reading the reveiws I am still worried about the reliability, but after finding out that the loudness is false I feel more secure with these. With a two year warranty like the penguin products I highly doubt they would make the new Maxijet Pro's as bad as some of the reviews have said. If anything, I can still use them as powerheads if the circulation mode fails. I have faith in marineland quality. I would recomend this to people with large tanks or people who keep fishes that love fast moving water! Oh.. and to add I think the black suction cups are great, much better than the crappy clear ones that come with the penguin models which seem to harden and become useless in half a year. I change out the clear ones and use the black suction cups and dont have problems with my powerhead falling anymore. With three of them I feel pretty safe. Maybe saltwater is different and much harder on the suction cups, makes sense since salt water tends to quickly dry out, crack, and corode rubber products...Update: Since using them for a little while I can see no problems with their reliability and they are solid powerheads like other marineland products. I do however have a little problem with them heating up my tank water. Since I live in a tropical climate my tanks are naturally around 82 to 84 degrees which is warm enough already. I put two in a thirty gallon tank and my tanks temperature skyrocketed to 90 degrees! I have since moved them into my 125 gallon and have no problems with them raising the temperature. Could be great if you live in a colder climate which could save you money on a heater!Update #2: After using them in circulation mode for a while I have noticed that they have a huge problem creating heat. They give off so much heat that they have even become a problem in my 125 gallon tank. I had to take one off and am now only running one of them. The temperature increase is not noticable with only one of them, but when I try to run two of them it can go up to 88 degrees (normal temperature hovers around 82-84 degrees) in my 125 gallon tank. The reason why I say 88 degrees and not higher is because when I noticed the temperature was that high I took one of them off imediately. Would be great using them in a cooler climate (would take some of the strain off your heater), but here in Hawaii it can be a problem. They are still silent and dont seem like they are anywhere near breaking. The trio of suction cups hold on good and strong. They do make a rather loud clicking/grinding noise when first starting them up (after unplugging them) that makes me think like they might break, but after a few seconds they start up perfectly and do their job very quietly. I think the problem is their large power consumption compared to other circulation powerheads/pumps. I have two Hydor Koralia Evo 1400's that dont even come close to heating the water even in my 30 gallon tank (they also dont make the loud clicking noise when restarting). Still if your looking for a cheap circulation/powerhead and you live in a cool climate, or only want to use one in a large tank, or have a really large tank, they work great. Don't know what happened to other reviewers maxijet pro's but mines are really really quiet, infact over time they have become SILENT. I have to literally put my ear up to the tank where they are mounted to hear anything from them, even then they are still hard to hear (after the restart that is).", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "08 4, 2011", "summary": "Very cool powerhead/ circulation pump."}

I don't think it's a bad product and I know that it works well for many dogs; but it REALLY didn't work for mine...and actually seemed to make him worse.My 2 year old German Shepherd was diagnosed with severe hip dysplasia at 5 months of age.  The orthopedist prescribed strong anti-inflammatories and pain meds for him to be on for the rest of his life.  Full hip replacement of both hips ($10,000) was only option with no guarantee that it would improve his quality of life.  I spent a lot of time researching online and talking to various holistic vets in hopes of finding a combination of natural supplements that would help his mobility and pain without destroying his liver.  The idea of giving a puppy these strong meds twice a day for the rest of his life seemed like a horrible plan.  After trying a few different well-known joint/health supplements, we settled on the one that seemed to offer him the most pain-free mobility.  Although his hind quarters will always wobble because of the joint defect, our current supplement regimen has allowed him to run and play with our other dog.  Usually 2-3 times a month, he'll still need the strong prescription meds after chasing too many tennis balls.Since he is still a very young dog, I have continued looking for other joint products to improve his joint cushioning.  After reading the positive reviews of the Hyaflex and talking to acquaintances who use it for their dogs, I emailed the Hyalogic company that produces it to see if it might work for situations such as my dog...or if it was intended more for older dogs suffering only from arthritis.  I have to say that their customer relations is GREAT.  The most I expected was an email response; but a representative of the company called me to address my questions.  She felt that it \"could\" work for my guy, but the main point she made was that it works great for many dogs, but not at all for some.  This is very consistent with everything I have read of hyaluronic acid for humans...whether it's knee injections or the oral form like this company's human version called Synthovial-7.  Hyaluronic acid works great for many, but not at all for others.It was worth it to me to give it a try.  So I ordered 2 bottles (not sure why I did that, maybe just optimistic?).  The Hyalogic rep indicated that if it is going to work for a dog, they generally experience noticeable improvement in 1-2 weeks.  After the first week on Hyaflex, it was tough to tell (mainly because he was already on a different, but very effective, natural supplement combination for inflammation/pain.  He did seem like he was more \"raring to go\" in the mornings; but was then considerably more stiff by late afternoons and through the evening.  I was still optimistic though; and I sort of excused his late day stiffness to the fact that he did seem like he was racing around more during the earlier parts of the day.  But after nearly 2 weeks on the Hyaflex drops, the afternoon/evening stiffness became much worse.  For the first time EVER, he would come to me whimpering in pain.  By early evening, he would struggle to stand up from a down position.  For the first time in well over a year, he was back on daily or twice/daily prescription meds.  I stopped adding the Hyaflex to his morning meal and he returned to normal (or his version of it) in a couple of days.Bottom-Line:  For those folks with dogs who don't respond to other joint supplements, I guess I would still recommend they try the Hyaflex; but with the understanding that their dog may be one of the ones that it doesn't help at all.  And also to watch for signs that their dog might be suffering from some type of reaction to it.  I do know a number of people who get great results for their dogs and swear by the product.", "overall": 2.0, "reviewTime": "09 23, 2012", "summary": "Works for some/Not others -- Use CAUTION"}

One cat (a kitten) doesn't care about the taste of the toothpaste, one cat sometimes acts interested in the paste, and a third cat actually comes running as though it's a treat.I highly recommend this product, and am so pleased that I found a brush that my cats don't run from.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "10 7, 2010", "summary": "One Cat Comes Running!"}

I've always only used a top quality water conditioner and he's alone. A few weeks ago I noticed he was not himself...not eating and staying in the corner all the time with little perky swimming. I keep him in a very large, old fashioned bathtub with a big fountain for water // oxygen. I also notice a type of white stuff on him. First it was very pale white then became almost like a white salt look on him. I went into a major panic and bought this product. (along with a few other's from Amazon for treating ich and other diseases).... I moved him into a small tank with this medicine and completely cleaned out his pond and fountain. I added this to his fresh new pond/tub, along with water conditioner called Stress Coat (which I've used for all these years with no problems at all)......I have a soft / large net to gently pick him up to move him and he was so quiet. He's usually a perky one....I got the net here on Amazon also. He's at least 9 inches and looks 'fat' to me so I worried it could be bloating too. I put him back into his fresh tank / tub and waited a day before trying to feed to reduce anymore stress. YAY, he is eating again and swimming. He does enjoy my company though, lol.....I just love him. He's bright orange and I don't see any signs of disease again, yet. I did notice at times now he'll spit out his fish food and go for tiny pieces of flake food on the bottom. That worries me a little bit so I've ordered new food for him too. I was very pleased with this product. Seemed safe and complete. It seems to have saved him and I am so grateful. I wish I knew what he'd enjoy eating so I can keep him happy and healthy. I hope he'll be around for a long time. THANK YOU for this product. I used the Aquarium salt too but I think using this product primarily, did the trick as did cleaning out his tank // tub area completely too. It arrived on time. Amazon has saved my day more than once!! Any suggestions would be welcome to keep my fish glowing  and going. Do I use it during EACH CHANGE? TIA~..............UPDATE:::: 12/18/2013 - Ohh no - My fish has that stuff on him again and he's not acting right. I bought him blood worms and new fish food of pellets (I have always only fed flake food) and he won't eat any of it now. He's not his perky self. He knows when I come in and swims over to me...is breaking my heart. I took pics of him but not sure if anyone can view them that knows goldfish. He seems 'off'....and a tiny // slight tilt. He does not fight me when I reach down to pass my hand over his side to remove those white thingys (like salt)). I don't like touching him as I may injure him more. IS THERE ANYONE TO ASSIST ME IN HERE? He has never been sick 1 single day in his life until we had to move to this horrid place. : (( - Should I attempt to move him outside as I have a big pond thingy out there for him but worry about wild animals then. I also bought Pimafix from Amazon but not sure if I can add it to his water too. It treats fungal infections. I just don't know the answer and don't want to make things more toxic. Thank you.>>>>>>>>>>>>>UPDATE Dec. 28, 2013 - ALL IS GOOD : ))) Ich is gone again and I keep re treating. This is a great product // Thank you and Elvee thanks you. You MUST re treat as this disease has cycles per my Marine Vet.********UPDATE January 9, 2014 - This did NOT cure the Ich - per my mobile fish vet today she told me to buy this from Amazon, which I did::::Mardel Quick-Cure Aquarium Treatment, 4-Ounce..............I did not know they \"sedate\" a goldfish to examine them.... I could not watch.. my vet is great and I purchased the new Ich medicine above, more oxygen piping, etc. My fish vet sedates my Elvee, in a separate bucket and it is Ich. Also my water was not right so I had to buy a API water test kit here on Amazon. You can never oxygenate too much.

Enzymatic Oral Hygiene Chews for Large Dogs, 30 Chews.\" It's not completely clear what the exact differences between these and the HEXTRA Premiums, but the chews do smell different (I think this has to do with the chicken flavoring on these which the Premiums don't have).And it turns out Baird loves these as well.One thing to remember is that if your dog has yellowed teeth, simple chews won't fix that. All you can do is get those teeth deep cleaned... however, this is just generally surface staining, so brushing and providing chews like these will actually clear the plaque. And the plaque is the part you are worried about, given that's what can cause health problems with your dogs.Over all, I'm happy that Baird's happy with these chews. If you can't brush your dog's teeth all the time, these make an OK alternative to brushing.C.E.T. HEXtra Premium Oral Hygiene Chews with Chlorhexidine, Large Dogs, 30 Chewsare available as well, they are just a few dollars more. Next time I order I will most likely go with the Premiums out of nothing more than personal preference.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "07 18, 2012", "summary": "Baird approved"}

Clean / sanitary water source at all times.  Definitely better than a bowl or bucket that often must be cleaned with anti-bacterial, anti-mold, anti-fungus cleaners.3. Easy for the dog to learn how to use.4. Eliminates your dog from 'playing' in its water which makes a mess and causes the dog to go without water for long periods until you get home/discover his full bowl is empty.5. No installation procedures to follow.  Just screw it on to your faucet as it has the same threads as your water hose.  Turn on your faucet and you are set.**Con's:1. *24 hours per day is contingent on the lixit not freezing or breaking.  You should check it daily as you would a bowl of water.  Common sense!  You should never NOT worry about your pet every day!  Besides, it takes just a second.  Press the trigger to see that water is flowing when testing.  The lixit can loosen over time and leak since it is suppose to be put on 'hand tight'.  I use pliers and tweak it just a fraction past hand tight and it holds for long periods of time.  Like water hoses, sometimes the rubber washer needs to be replaced.2.  It is an 'outdoor application only' for use on your outdoor faucet. **NOTE: I recommend you NOT share a hose with it and DEDICATE the faucet to the dog waterer ONLY, as it would be easy to forget and turn off the knob after watering your lawn thus depriving your dog of water!  In fact, I recommend you turn on the lixit then take the knob off of your faucet so no one will accidentally turn it off.  If you are handy, you could tap into your water line and construct a dedicated water line just for your pet!3. Freezing is a common problem.  I've never had a frozen lixit ruin my faucet.  What happens it that the lixit is made from a metal that is a bit softer than a faucet so the freezing water causes the lixit to expand around the threads.  It has never ruined my faucet and lixits are fairly inexpensive so I keep an extra on hand.  If you live in northern climates, you'll have to put the lixit on a faucet that is located in an area that does not freeze.  It's worthless in freezing weather.  If you have outdoor dogs in cold climates, better to go with a heated bowl / kennel.4. They do wear out eventually.  Usually the trigger gets stuck to one side and it dribbles water.  I've had lixits last 2 or more years.5. Direct sun does warm up the chrome colored metal lixit but with just a few seconds of water it cools right off and does not deter the dog from drinking.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "02 7, 2011", "summary": "Lixit user for over 10 years"}

I absolutely love it!I'm one of those classic individuals who hates to clean, especially when it comes to the cat box--yet I'm also a warped version of a germaphobe. I can't tell you how many times I've blown it off, sometimes for days, just to avoid the mess, or how many times I've had fouled up litter spill all over me. Eww! In fact, I always feel like I have to wait to shower until after I clean it, which sometimes will wait all day and I've cleaned the entire rest of the house in order to avoid the task. Enough said!This litter box is amazing and I'm actually \"sifting\" it several times a day, which even my partner is amazed by--it's that easy. Better yet, I don't feel like I need to be quarantined after emptying it, which is a definite plus, and hardly any litter is kicked out by my over-eager diggers (we're talking hardly anything), thanks to the height of the actual tray--meaning, I'm not walking on much litter when I come out of the shower, though I do plan on buying a litter mat soon and turning the box away from my walking path. I use Fresh Step and Scoop Away, which both seem to work fine in this box, though I normally get Fresh Step for Multiple cats.Thanks to the reviews on here, I got it in the large to accommodate my cats, especially one who is a hefty 18lbs, but mostly due to him being the size of our dogs. The size is a bit of a burden, especially if you don't have a lot of space in your room, and it is tall, but two feet will suffice--though four feet may be needed to efficiently roll it. I also had trouble with litter spilling out during my rollfest, but then realized the grate (possibly kicked out by my cat in the beginning) and clips weren't in correctly, and this resolved the problem without any other incidents. I do get some used litter sticking to the tray, which is nothing new, but smacking the bottom mid-roll helps this (or using a hand sifter to scrape the bottom quickly before rolling will help if it's really bad). I may also try the suggestion of using Pam spray on the bottom the next time I change litter, but still debating and will update if I do.In order to add to my lazy and time-saving endeavors, I also got the Litter Locker, which is used to store waste in as you empty the box until I can be bothered to run to the dumpster. A simple turn of the device traps odors in a waste bag until you're ready to toss it out (like a Diaper Genie). It also comes with a sifter that fits into a pocket on the contraption. This is great for when I'm pressed for time and also eliminates steps during moments of utter laziness, and the tray with this litter box actually works perfectly with it. Lastly, for odor control (for before cleaning and due to a dog practically living in my room), I also love and use the Febreze Odor Eliminators, which are carbon air filters to get rid of room/pet odors. Can't smell a thing and cleaning is even easier, taking less than 30 seconds (even with me having to turn the box to roll it), and this box definitely is the icing on the cake.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "08 8, 2010", "summary": "Omega Magic!"}

It looks really good and is made with quality materials. The concept of using a dog's natural burrowing instinct is amazing!!! We had no issue with the opening staying propped up and open. It was extremely fluffy like others mentioned, but it's stuffing -- you can see that it will matte down with continued use.

And with over 550 treats per bag, they go a long way.They are MADE IN THE USA, have only 3 calories per treat, and contain neither soy, corn, nor BHA, BHT, or ethoxyquin (artificial preservatives).The primary ingredient is Pork Liver (chicken is 5th on the list - see below). Pork Liver is a nutrient-rich organ which provides your dog with protein, fat and vitamin A. It is also a good source of copper, iron, niacin, phosphorus and zinc. It provides many B vitamins, omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, and essential amino acids. Liver is of great benefit to your dog's health when offered in moderation (too much can lead to a condition called hypervitaminosis A, or an overdose of vitamin A). These little treats are a great way to add the benefits of liver to your dog's diet.They are also great for crate training, too. Just give them to your dog through the crate door as soon as you put them in and eventually they will associate something good with being crated. Soon enough you can just toss 2 or 3 in the crate when you need to crate them and they will happily go right in. My dogs have their own room that their crates are in. When I open the door to their room they run and get in the crates sometimes quicker than I can put their training rewards in.INGREDIENTS: Pork Liver, Barley Flour, Whole Ground Potatoes, Sucrose, Chicken, Potato Starch, Glycerine, Wheat Bran, Gelatin, Rice Flour, Flax Seed, Salt, Natural Smoke Flavor, Garlic Powder, Phosphoric Acid, Potassium Sorbate, Mustard, Citric Acid, Mixed Tocopherols, Rosemary", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "11 16, 2012", "summary": "PRODUCT INGREDIENTS; Excellent training reward my dogs love..."}

We had been using a clumping litter which was working out pretty well, except for the litter being tracked around our apartment.  This was annoying. To make things worse, our cat is a digger, so every visit to the litter box meant he emerged covered in a layer of dust.  We decided to look for some litter alternatives and decided on the Tidy Cats Breeze system.The benefits include: not having to scoop out urine clumps daily, no tracking, no dust.The downsides include: if your cat is a digger, you are going to have pellets scattered around your floor, and since you don't change the pellets frequently, there are going to be pellets stained with feces and urine on your floor.  Also, there is VERY poor odor control.  We have set up air purifiers around the apartment, but they can't fight the odor from cat feces.  Since the feces can't be buried as they would be with clay litters, they remain exposed, filling your bathroom (and the rest of your apartment) with the noxious smell of poo, until you clean them up.

I have not tried medium light plants with this light so I cannot offer any hint to if they would or would not thrive.I have the tank on a 7.5 hour light cycle and have not had any real issue with algae yet (but I do have an algae eater in there too).  I use a light timer so I don't have to remember to turn them on and off.  I've never used the blue &#34;night&#34; lights only the day-time ones so no comments for the blue lights.I will also note my Madagascar rainbow fish looks very good under this light, the yellow/orange colors of its scales/fins show much better under these LEDs than the florescent bulbs of their old tank.  My other fish (pleco) likes to hide under his driftwood during the day to stay out of the lights, but the Marinelands make the tank bright enough you can see great detail in his hide (not a scaled fish) compared to florescent bulbs.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "01 17, 2014", "summary": "Adequet for low light plants in taller tanks."}

I was told by my allergist that I needed to either wear a mask when I scooped the litter or have my husband scoop it for me (which isn't gonna happen). I was never a huge fan of the clay litter with all of the dust that it kicks up and I had started using the new pine/walnut clumping litter but it sort of smelled like a dirty gerbil cage after a week or two. Plus there was litter everywhere. No matter the litter I tried, I found myself scooping away for at least 3 minutes (thanks to my yoga posing kitty who always manages to pee right along the litter pan wall).I'm a fan of this litter box because all I have to do is scoop the poop out and once a week replace the pee pad underneath. I have 3 cats (1 with kidney disease and another on steroids) so the two of them urinate a lot, and I still only have to change the pad once a week. Switching from normal litter to this box has saved me from fits of insane sneezing every night.However, if you are looking to eliminate litter box odor.... it doesn't. Poop is poop, and if it smells it smells. It's like one of those riddles, if you poop on the floor instead of in the toilet, does the poop still stink? ... yes! When they poop in the litter box, it smells like my kitty just took a deuce, regardless of the fancy litter. And when I pull out the pee pad to rotate it, it smells like a pissy diaper. But I didn't get it to eliminate smell, I got it to eliminate the dust from the litter and the clean up time due to allergies and that is exactly what it has done for me. So for what I bought it for, I give it two thumbs up. My only complaint, the litter/pad price and the fact that I cannot find them locally, so therefor I must order them online. Otherwise, love it!*On a side note. I know people who have this box and have converted it to a normal litter box by using those pine pellet litters instead of the fancy stuff this is supposed to use. It helps cut down on cost and if you bought this litter box and your cat doesn't like it, I'd give the pine litter a try and see if they just didn't like the pellets.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "06 26, 2013", "summary": "Great for people with allergies"}

And in the past it worked great for our dog as well.Prescribed antibiotics took until day 6 or 7 to kick in (on a 10 day cycle) and by contrast, the Vibactra kicked in on day 2. And it saved me $100 in vet fees.I always prefer natural remedies, whether its for myself, my children, or my pets. They have fewer side effects (often none at all), and are more gentle on the body. Plus, if you read the literature (Journal of American Academy of Pediatrics, Journal of American Medical Association), studies show these ingredients are often more powerful than prescription antibiotics.I must giggle when people say you can't have a \"natural\" antibiotic. The very first Penicillin (discovered by Alexander Fleming) was straight-up mold! Can't get more natural than that. No chemicals, nothing artificial, etc.The only drawback is, you have to give 4 doses per day. But even when I missed a dose or two, it still seemed to work faster than the prescription stuff.My other recommendations: If you have a pet who gets frequent infections, has topical infections, etc, try these two things:(1) Colloidal Silver (2 sprays orally, daily of 150ppm for a small animal). This is also proven just as effective as prescription antibiotics, and there is no drug interaction when used with Vibactra. Can also be used topically, but not on open wounds.Also (2) Grapefruitseed Extract is a powerful antibiotic & immune booster - just add 1 or 2 drops to food or water (do not feed directly).Hope this helps!", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "11 3, 2012", "summary": "Powerful antibiotic - only 1 drawback (plus some other tips here)"}

It is a remote-shaped device with an auto feature for barking, as well as a manual button that can be activated when your dog acts up.DESIGNThe first thing I noticed about it, is the ridiculous amount of excess packaging.  The box is the size of a shoe box, while the remote is maybe the size of a small baked potato, and the only thing else it comes with is a 2 page manual. You could fit 4 of the devices in one box, and most of it is empty space, likely in an effort to consume more shelf space in stores and attract more attention.  The actual device has a bit of an awkward design.  It is shaped like a tube of moisturizing cream, with a somewhat slim base that gets wider, ending with a circular speaker. It's easy enough to use at home, but it doesn't fit in a pocket very well, and there's no belt clip, making it awkward to take on a walk.  There is a power button on the side of the device.  You press it once to turn it to auto, again to turn it to manual, and again to turn it back off.  Seems easy enough, but it doesn't register your presses very well.  I was constantly pressing the button, and then staring at it to wait for the light that indicates what setting it is on to flash (it comes on after about five seconds), and then trying to cycle back to the right setting when I realized it wasn't on the one I wanted.  If your dog starts barking, you can't easily pick this up and use it quickly.HOW IT WORKSYou initially train the device by waiting until your dog is tired or resting, then cycle through one of the five frequencies until you pick one your dog responds to. I have a young dog so he picked up on the first one right away. The next step is to wait until your dog initiates bad behavior, then do a manual correction by pressing the button. This will emit the saved frequency. The idea is that the frequency is annoying or unpleasant to your dog. When your dog barks or jumps, you hit the manual button which will send out the frequency.  The dog then associates the unpleasant frequency with the behavior they have just committed, and will learn to stop the behavior.  This is the exact same training method as saying \"NO,\" hitting your dog on the nose, or using a shock collar, and is commonly referred to as negative reinforcement behavior.  An ultrasonic noise is designed to be more humane than some of these.  The auto feature on the device works only for barking, and will emit the frequency automatically whenever your dog barks.USEFinding the correct frequency for my dog took about fifteen minutes.  The first problem is that you have to get the training device fairly close to your dog, and once he knew I was using it, he was very interested in it, so it was difficult to determine when he was registering a frequency. Additionally, he picked up on more than one frequency.  I was finally satisfied I had the one he responded best to, however he was far from annoyed by it.  He definitely heard it, but only registered mild curiosity with it, and I had to have the device about a foot away from his ear for him to do that.  The problem with that is, even if he was annoyed by the sound, the action of trying to hold the device close enough to his ear is going to distract him from the negative behavior anyway, so this won't work.  Since my dog is right at the required 6 months, and since the device advertises that it only works on 66% of dogs, I went off to find more test subjects.I went to my dog trainer's class and tried it out on the dogs in the group as well as several friends' dogs. My trainer took one look at the device and told me it was never going to work, but I tried it out anyway.  Out of fourteen dogs, only two appeared to be genuinely affected with the sound, and even those two did not seem to exhibit annoyance with it, but rather curiosity.  If the sound isn't unpleasant to them, it's not going to be effective for me.  After two days, the only one annoyed was me at having to spend so much time programming the device to find the right frequency for each dog.I will say that the auto method did seem to pick up on the barking very well, and it worked to silence the barking, but not because the dogs were annoyed, but because they were distracted.  One dog even appeared to bark more. I will continue to use it on more dogs and see if possibly my sample size was just too small (although that would be a big coincidence), and update this review if I find it to be any more effective.CONCLUSIONI have studied both positive and negative reinforcement.  I am a fan of the former, but find the latter to be more effective in most dogs. With Havahart advertising that the product only works on 2/3 dogs, you are taking a gamble on whether you will have any luck with it on your own dog.  Even if it does register with the dog, I find that it's not enough of a negative reinforcement to eliminate the bad behavior. For training to work, you have to have a strong enough deterrent to eliminate the behavior, and it must be consistent.  The Havahart lacks both.  Unless you are trying to correct a behavior that you can predict 100% of the time, it won't work because you can't activate it fast enough.  If your dog has a problem with jumping and you don't have the Havahart on and ready to go at every jump, he will learn that he can get away with jumping some of the time.  I would advise anyone considering any type of ultrasonic training aid, to borrow one or find out if it works first before committing to it.  If you can afford to spend a little more, I would recommend going with a bark collar or shock collar instead. Although some may think these are inhumane, I have used them on myself, and as long as you learn the appropriate way to train with them, and get one that has a highly adjustable level (like aDogtra IQ - Yard Training Collar), they will not hurt your dog at all and can be much more humane in the long run when your dog quickly sheds the negative behavior.", "overall": 1.0, "reviewTime": "06 25, 2012", "summary": "12 out of 14 dogs agree - this thing doesn't work"}

Sometimes, it takes more than one can for problems to make themselves known, but I would definitely feed this again.  The only ingredient it has listed that gives me pause is starch, probably for the gravy.  Cats don't need it, but if you're trying to feed a finicky sick kitty, sometimes you have to feed them what tastes good.For reference, my cats will eat Fancy Feast.  They won't eat cat gravy or any of their prescription diets or Felidae or the delicious-looking Tiki flavors.  They like Friskies, but it makes Mary-Kate sick.

The other cans looked fine upon inspection, so I stored them in a safe place and thought all would be okay from there on in. Unfortunately, weeks after the initial order, I noticed that other cans were showing signs of damage too i.e. sunken or slightly distorted tops that were not dented upon my first inspection.  I know that nothing damaged these cans in the interim, so I believe their seals must have been compromised when the others were initially dented, and with time the vacuum must have been compromised which resulted in the cave ins.  I was not going to take a chance and give contaminated food to my dogs, so I ended up throwing out 5 cans (there goes my savings). Thereafter, I also felt nervous to give my dogs food from the other cans that remained.

Also, reveiwing others comments, I have noticed I was not alone in this experience.  If cans aren't packaged with some insulation, there is probably a good chance they will get dented.

The brand name \"SafeStart\" will certainly initially lead some people to think that this product is all that is needed to start up a tank. The directions state \"add entire bottle to aquariums up to 40 gallons. The Aquarium is ready for fish\".  Silly me, but after reading that, I thought that after adding the product, I would not see all but one of my fish dying within one hour.  A few paragraphs down it addresses tank preparation with a whopping 6 words.  One might think that this should have appeared above the line \"The Aquarium is ready for fish\", not buried in fine print 2 paragraphs below in print so small one can hardly read it.  Does it not make sense that preparation instructions should precede, not follow a few paragraphs later?  Even so, I was not sure what those 6 words meant, it seemed to me to be just an advertisement for one of their superfluous products.  Never does it mention toxic chemicals, whether this product removes them or not.  Just call me silly, but perhaps, if space was an issue, rather than using 9 words to address keeping your aquarium at a suitable temperature, they might have more sensibly used those to explicitly state \"this product does not remove toxic chemicals\" and had two words to spare. All of these elements make is likely that a number of people will misunderstand what the product does, and does not do.  I am not the only person that was left confused by this, whether it removes toxic chemicals, another recent review states something similar.  I am certain that an unacceptable number of people such as the less experienced, or children, will misconstrue the purpose of this product, and end up with dead fish as I did.  I consider directions such as this negligent, a little thought should be given to where the purchaser might be confused.  The person that commented on my earlier review made me think of professors I had in in school who had horrible communication skills, but felt that they put it on the board, if you missed it, or misunderstood it, it was your fault, they had done their job.  But with pets one is always faced with this risk, as you really can't sue them over pets, and they know it.  With people, corporations are a heck of a lot more careful about what a judge might find to be poorly expressed directions that resulted in a tragedy.Regarding the usefulness of this product for what it does, the only time I have ended up with dead fish starting a tank is when I used this product, thinking that it neutralized the chlorine, the one big thing that you have to really worry about.  A lot of people consider other than clearly essential additives, items such as this are just gimmicks, and I concur with that.  I would not use it again, I only got it because I thought that it did what the brand name said \"SafeStart\" and that the words \"The aquarium is then ready for fish\" meant that my fish would not die if I treated the water with this product.", "overall": 1.0, "reviewTime": "04 5, 2014", "summary": "WARNING!"}

I bought this for my Betta, but now wish I had not. The tank is nice enough, but not really appropriate for the pet I have (that's my fault, I wasn't thinking)Since the tank is skinny and very deep, you'll want very tall plants if you hope to near the top (the XL 18 inches will come close). Bettas like to sleep near the top, using a plant as a hammock, so I suction cupped one to the top - not exactly the look I was going for.For most fish, (esp. Bettas) a heater is a must - add $15-20 to the price.It comes with a tiny filter - not great for a Betta because they don't care for moving water. Since its long and skinny, there is poor surface area on top. I had to turn the filter off so that his food doesn't blow around when i feed him. I finally just stopped using the filter, since Bettas need to be near the top of the tank to get some breaths of air.And the 360 viewing experience? The curve of it obscures what i can view. I often can't find him if he stays along the sides.Since the 6 gallon was only a few dollars more than the 3 gallon version, I figured I'd be crazy not to get it -- it looks a bit lumbering. If i want to vacuum the gravel, I'll need to buy one of those giant ones like I used to have for my 75 gallon tank, since this tank is easily 24 inches high.I'm going to do some research and see what else I can put in this tank and move my betta back to a gallon tank.The night light feature is awesome - you can choose blue, white or my fav, blue/white combo. if this is in a kids room for a night light, then neato, although I doubt the constant stimulation would be happy for your pet.I hope some of these points can help you decide if this product fits your individual needs.", "overall": 3.0, "reviewTime": "10 12, 2012", "summary": "Some things to consider first"}

I added a second bag of bio-beads as this tank was replacing a \"standard\" 5 gallon that had a betta and a couple oto cats in it.  By using the bio-beads from the existing tank's filter I had no concerns about cycling the tank before moving my fish into it.The filter pump is surprisingly powerful for its small size, even on the lowest setting, so much so that I had to make a spray bar return for it to reduce the force of the water coming back from the filter.  My betta was getting \"blown\" around the tank because the current was so strong, and it made us both unhappy.  With the home-made spray bar my betta was much more comfortable.Because the center of the lid is open (so it doesn't block any of the light from the LEDs) the tank is prone to evaporation loss more than it otherwise would be. As I do weekly water changes this isn't much of an issue, and it is common with open-topped tanks anyway.  But I wanted others to know that it is something to deal with if that matters to you.The light works well and my live plants are growing nicely with it.  The screw that holds the light bar in place is only plastic, and seems to have stripped the threads even with careful handing, so I will probably have to replace it with a metal screw so the light bar is more secure.  I have the light on a timer, so the 2-way switch for white vs. blue LEDs is not an issue to me, but if you don't use a timer on the light you'll have to manually switch from white daytime to blue nighttime lighting.Everyone who's seen the tank comments on how good it looks!  I'm very glad I bought it even with having to make the minor modification of the filter return.

It will poop in the litterbox, but nothing else we have tried--special sprays, litters, extra litterboxes, etc.--has convinced that cat to pee in the litterbox.  If we put a litterbox where the cat is peeing on the floor, the cat chooses a new spot to pee on the floor.  We even had to give this cat its own private suite (a room larger than our bedroom) because it hates the other cats and hates strangers, and any extra aggravation causes it to pee and poop everywhere (one time it even smeared poop on the wall because it didn't like one of my wife's friends).So needless to say, I was skeptical when I read the \"100% litterbox use or your money back.  I guarantee it!\" label on Dr. Elsey's litter.  I told my wife we should try it, but we both shook our heads and said we were going to have to put that money-back guarantee to use.Now here's the amazing part: we've been using this stuff mixed about half and half with normal clumping litter for a few months now, and the cat doesn't pee on the floor any more.  Although Dr. Elsey's Cat Attract litter is expensive, I don't think the price difference is any more than what we were paying for the training pads before, especially since we've been able to get away with mixing Dr. Elsey's litter with normal litter.  On top of that, the room doesn't smell like a pool of urine.  This stuff might not work for all cats, but it worked for ours.

This medication will treat a variety of internal parasites from your fish.As a previous reviewer has stated, thorough treatment is required when fighting some of the more persistent internal parasites, like roundworms.  Start the treatment as soon as you suspect internal parasites.  Your chances, the fish chances, are much better if you start the treatment while they are still eating.  If you wait until after they stop eating, then you are limited to medicating the water in the tank.  The best way is to also mix fenbendazole with the fish food and feed it to the fish in conjunction with treating the water.The fish will be more likely to accept the medication if you mix it with frozen food.  You can thaw frozen shrimp and soak it in fenbendazole.  For added efficiency, you can use a binder like Seachem focus to help draw the medication into the food.  You can also try mixing with flakes, but the flakes will get soggy and messy.The main value of this medication to me is its use as a preventative.  I feed this to newly-acquired fish.  Basically, I make the assumption that the new fish are infected and treat accordingly.  This medication will not harm the fish and it will clear away internal parasites that may be hitching a ride on your new fish.  In this manner, in the event that the fish are exposed to a stressor later on, at least they will not succumb to intestinal worms.  Even if the fish do get stressed, if there are no low-level camallanus worm infection in any of the fish in the tank, they will not get infected.Some hobbyists use canine de-wormer on their fish.  However, this is not an expensive product and you will be better off simply using the fenbendazole that is already packaged for use with tropical fish.  This will save you from having to buy canine tablets and having to ground it into a fine powder.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "04 5, 2014", "summary": "Another weapon in your arsenal against fish parasites."}

{"reviewerID": "A2AWVROFGSZU4E", "asin": "B001F2GDO4", "reviewerName": "My Fake Name", "helpful": [1, 3], "unixReviewTime": 1362441600, "reviewText": "****I have conducted extensive research on Rachael Ray and have arrived at the following conclusions: (1) She has received no non-honorary degrees from any colleges or universities domestically or internationally that would suggest she's an expert in formulating dog food.  (2) She has never been employed in an AAFCO-approved laboratory capacity at a major dog-food concern.  (3) She's cute.  For this I neither add nor subtract any stars.It's reasonable to conclude that her name on the package of the product under review, Rachael Ray Nutrish Dry Dog Food, Beef & Rice Recipe, 6-Pound Bag, implies not the application of her expertise in formulating this and the other types of dog food in the Rachael Ray line but rather her willingness to lend the considerable selling power of her name and face in exchange for money.  (I want a job like that.)So, since we cannot rely on Ms. Ray's own personal expertise in formulating dog foods, how can we decide whether this particular product, which presumably WAS formulated by experts, is a good one both for the dog and for the price?****The list of ingredients and their ranking by prevalence is a good start.  If, for example, the first three ingredients are cow dung, hay and sand, you can be pretty sure the rest of the ingredients, no matter how healthful they are, are not going to make up for those first three.  The first three ingredients in the product under review, in order, are said to be beef, chicken meal and ground rice, some of which sound edible to me.  Also included are tomatoes, olive oil and parsley, which sound like a good start on a spaghetti sauce.  Also included are such mysteries as pyridoxine hydrochloride, cobalt sulfate and sodium selenite, but, unlike as with, say, sand, I'm pretty sure the manufacturer wouldn't go to the trouble and expense of adding them for no reason.****Another factor is whether dogs will eat it.  To test this I offered my dog, PheyeG'hdeaux, whose seventh birthday is today, an unbiased choice between an ounce of his regular dog food, Eukanuba, and an ounce of the product under review.  He ran up to the two bowls on the floor, thinking at least one of them had a true treat such as melted ice cream or taco detritus in it, and he sniffed the Eukanuba bowl first, then the Rachael Ray bowl, then he ate the Rachael Ray, then the Eukanuba.  This doesn't prove much, because if his regular food for years had been Rachael Ray and I offered him Eukanuba he might have eaten the Eukanuba first just because he was tired of the Rachael Ray and wanted to experience new tastes and smells.  For this I neither add nor subtract any stars.****The price on Amazon as of this writing is $10.98 for six pounds, which works out to $1.83 per pound.  The price of the Eukanuba I buy from a store averages about $1.20 per pound, which makes the Rachael Ray about 50% costlier.  That's a considerable difference.  If you feed your dog(s) a mere 100 pounds a year, the Rachael Ray costs $63 more annually [($1.83 - $1.20) * 100 = $63], or $5.25 more per month.  Of course, all of the foregoing assumes Eukanuba is at least as healthful for and appealing to your dog as the product under review, which I assume it is because it's the brand my dog's vet and this other expert on dog foods recommend.  For this I subtract one star from five.****Wanting to go beyond what's expected, for the entertainment of the handful of people who will read this review all the way down to here, I now report on things this product, which I remind you is dog food, can and cannot substitute for.-- Can substitute for giraffe food in a pinch.-- Cannot substitute for panda or koala food, even in a pinch.-- Can substitute for weight in your trunk to get more traction for a rear-wheel drive car in the snow, but you'll need a lot more than one 6-pound bag.-- Cannot substitute for sand when mixing concrete according to the standard dry recipe of 1 part cement (a powder), 2 parts sand, and 3 parts gravel.-- Can substitute, however inconveniently, for a door stop.-- Cannot substitute for six pounds of gold, at least not in sheer value.  As of today's writing gold is worth $1,590.80 per ounce, which makes six pounds worth 6 times 16 ounces times $1,590.80, which is $152,716.80, which is a LOT more than $10.98.Five stars minus 1 for the price is four.****", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "03 5, 2013", "summary": "Better than gold"}

I only need a filter to catch floating solids and to keep the temperature in the tank even along with nutrients for the plants. The vast majority of freshwater fish that people keep come from swamps, bogs, flooded rivers, and very slow moving streams. The common factor is low (but not zero) water movement.The filter compartment itself contains just a regular course sponge, which is perfectly fine. It will hold up for a long time (compared to a pad) and is easy enough to remove for washing. Above the sponge is a very small compartment that comes pre-filled with loose activated carbon. That went straight into the trash, activated carbon does absolutly nothing for a planted aquarium, and very little otherwise with how infrequent people tend to replace it. In its place I put a small bit of filter floss (otherwise known as poly fil from a craft store, or quilt batting also works) that increases the filters performance with small particles.Noise wise the filter is pretty quite. You can hear the hum, but it is less that you would get from a HOB or sponge filter. The power for this filter is DC instead of the more normal AC so it comes with a 'wall wort' as I call it, the large plug that takes up space near the outlets.I use this with a Betta, but it would also be fine for an invert tank (shrimp and snails).

I ended up just forcing it on there and screwing it as tight as I could, and it's very sturdy despite that.**I found two downsides with this tree, but both are special circumstances, if you have a special needs cat, please read**  So the only issues I had were as follows: One is that my blind kitten would go to the very top platform, and get a bit confused on how to get down.  The two side platforms are pretty low down compared to the highest one, so if you have a blind cat who will \"feel\" her way down, just know that you might have to \"rescue\" your cat a few times when she gets stuck up there.  The second issue I had was with my other kitten, who has moderate CH.  He simply cannot climb up the bottom portion of the cat house (and as a moderate CH cat, of course, has almost 0 real jumping ability).  He can climb the lower sisal posts, but the \"lip\" of the bottom house and platforms are too much for him to overcome.  I'm going to have to get a set of cat stairs to put against the lower part, so he can get up there.  Once he's up on the lower portion, he can successfully climb to the top house, though, again, he cannot climb over the \"lips\" of the very top platforms.  Still, he seems thrilled to be even 3/4 of the way up the tree.  Just note that if your cat has problems jumping/coordinating, you may need pet stairs to help them overcome the lower part.(Of course the \"normal\" foster kittens has no issues at all leaping and climbing on this tree. ^)The highest sisal post seems to be the cool place to be for all the kittens, and they spend a lot of time taking turns hugging it and just chilling on top of the highest little house, playing and scratching on that sisal post.The little hanging toys are a massive hit, and I'm surprised they're still holding strong now on the second day, as they were receiving ridiculous amounts of kitten abuse.I also got this tree in about 4 business days, which is wayyyyyyyyyyyy under the amount of time it was going to take just to \"process\" it from other sellers who were charging more!

He works very well inside the house, but once I take him outside, anything can happen.I wanted to try this product to see if I could correct some very bad behaviors he has picked up. He is a jumper. It used to be OK when he was a puppy, but now he's 70 lbs and he will jump on small kids at the park. I'm afraid that his jumping habit is going to injure a child in the future, so I wanted to correct this ASAP. He also likes to sprint full speed when going to meet someone. He doesn't really deccelerate and one time, he even knocked down my GF by taking her legs out from under her and he messed up her knee pretty good (she is currently wearing a knee brace). Normally, I would hate to use a collar that administers any sort of pain. But in all reality, he is an animal, and I can't risk any more injuries to humans. We tried formal positive reinforcement training, which was good for him, but didn't seem to solve his high-energy and jumping problems. So those are my reasons for wanting to use this collar.All the being said... I only had to \"correct\" my dog once at level 3. He felt it and knew immediately that what he was doing at the time was wrong. Since that one time, I have not had to use the correction again. I was so surprised!! What I mainly like about this collar is that it helps me to get my dogs attention again in a distracting environment. He is a smart dog. He knows his commands, and he knows to listen to me. So once I have his attention, he is a very good boy. This collar helps me get his attention and I have the option to use the \"correction\" if I feel like he is putting a human at risk for injury (which has not happened since we started using this product).

The advantage of using a larger size clipper is for those of us with older hands &#8211; large clippers are easier to grip and they require less force to get through the nail.The overall build quality is very good. They feel solid, and the handles are ergonomically shaped to permit a good, solid grip without any slippage or hand pain. The cutters are sharp and have no problems getting through a nail.The cutters have a stopper to avoid cutting into the quick of the nail. The stopper would work fine with a large nail, but for cats, the stopper is ineffective. That&#8217;s not a problem, since my old clippers (which were small-sized for cats) had a stopper which I never used. I prefer to just pay attention to where the quick is, and avoid it since it can vary from nail-to-nail.It includes a small nail file which is stored right in the handle, and can be pulled out when needed.

In most books, she qualifies as medium. I also have a 13 pound Siberian cat, which is usually listed as a large breed cat.These clippers are marked on the package for medium and large breeds, with photos of a dog and cat together. Judging by the looks of the clippers, they are better suited to the thick nails of my dog than my cat. I didn't realize that my dog keeps her nails pretty short. I don't ever cut them, so I thought they'd be longer but they look totally trimmed. I tried the nail clippers out instead on my cat.I was afraid I would accidentally cut something other than her nails (the nail cutter is big and unwieldy for such small paws). I didn't use the guide, since it was about 3/16 inches deep, and her nails didn't need to be cut that short. All went well, but for cats, I prefer the smaller cat nail clipper I already own.This is one heavy duty, well-built nail clippers. It has a safety latch, keeping it closed when not in use, and rubberized handles for a good grip. I like the guide, which my cat nail clipper also has, and there's a nail file stored inside the handle. For a medium or large dog with long nails, these clippers would be useful. For cats, even large cats, it's too big.This product was provided for review by Pet Magasin._______________UPDATE 4/29/14: While looking at my dog's paws, I noticed one exceptionally long nail. These clippers cut her thick nail with ease. They are very heavy duty.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "04 28, 2014", "summary": "Heavy Duty"}

I will admit it took about 18 months for the litter box to become unusable.Several years ago we purchased an automated self-cleaning litter box. It worked OK, and the cats would use it, but it was ugly. The cats did not like the tent cover so the litter box was left open for all to view.Another problem with the self-cleaning automated litter box was the cost and difficulty of finding the plastic collection containers. Finally, the box had to be plugged into an outlet or run off a battery.The Omega litter box solved all those problems. The box is self-contained and the unsightly litter box is covered. The box contains a reusable pull-out tray. Finally, the box is human powered when it comes to cleaning the litter box. No batteries are required for this task.To use:  Fill the box with a clumping litter. Attach the top. Make sure the tray is inserted.Daily roll the box towards the tray. Remove the tray and toss the soiled litter into a container. Refill the box with clean litter as needed.Tip: Keep a plastic bag or storage container near the box. Each day empty the tray into the bag/container. I use old plastic grocery bags for this purpose. At the end of the week seal the bag and throw in the trash.Tip: Be sure the tab closures are fully locked in place otherwise the box lid will fall off and the litter will dump onto the floor. The tabs should be a bit sturdier but they are not. It is about the only negative thing that I can write about this litter box design.Updated Aug 8: Am very frustrated with the poor quality tab closures.

There are no crumbles, no breaking apart, no gunky/pasty spots on the bottom. Scent control is great. The only exception to the scent control is that one of our cats does not cover her #2, so when she uses the box, it does smell some. I have 3 cats and 3 litter boxes. The only time I notice any bad smells is when that one cat uses it, since she doesn't cover it.I can keep scooping the litter box until there is basically no litter left in there. There is much less wasted litter and a box of this lasts a long time, since you are able to completely scoop out all of the &#34;used&#34; litter.I like the scent and the cats do not seem to mind it at all. I don't think it is a strong scent either. You can smell it a little when you pour it in the litter box, but after that I do not smell it at all.There is NO dust at all and very minimal tracking.I have a septic system and I scoop this and flush it. I haven't had any issues so far with clogging or backing up in the system.It is priced the same as any other clumping litter but definitely works better. You can download a coupon on the Clump & Seal website too, for even more savings.I have also used the multicat version of this and it works just as well. It seems the only difference is the scent and the strength of the scent. The multicat version has a little more of a stronger scent, but again you only smell it the first time you pour it in the litter box and after that you don't smell it. I have seen some reviews that say you can smell the perfume in the litter all over the house and that seems a little crazy to me, unless perhaps you have a really extra super powered nose. I have a litter box in one of our smaller bathrooms and you cant even smell it n that small area. I cannot imagine being able to smell it throughout the house or anywhere really.

If something happens to this one, I will buy another.Very easy to keep clean, and great improvement over the perpetually slimy, and quickly empty, standard water bowl.Definitely not a &#34;display piece&#34;, but much rather see this than watch the dogs drink from the toilet, which they tried to do before having their own &#34;running water&#34;.Dogs gravitate - I keep it in back part of the house for &#34;aesthetic&#34; reasons, but visiting dogs go right to it and drink w no concerns.SUGGESTIONS FOR USE or INSTALLATION:  I occasionally throw a couple of ice cubes on top - part melts, making water slightly cooler, before the dog fishes them out, a bit of a game for them.  I plan to add a timer so that it cycles off occasionally through the night.  Hopefully will save electricity, keep from overheating, and reduce use of filter.  I occasionally turn it off manually from time to time for short periods, which so far worked to allow the plug to cool without any negative impact.CONS:  I do have the following concerns.a) The plug is perpetually hot.  If it does run out of water, it continues to run and gets very hot, not smoking or a burn risk, but a bit of a concern.  An 'auto off' would be nice, but had this feature been added at an added cost, I doubt I would have tried it.b) Had one instance where the carbon from the filter wound up in the drinking water, probably because it was reused longer than recommended.

I bought one of each of our dogs and they are so comfortable that they don't even mind wearing them... which has not been the case with other harnesses. I bought large for our medium sized dogs because reviewers said they run small... and they fit perfect with just a little room to grow.My only complaints... and the reason I gave it only 4 stars was 1) They are a little difficult to adjust to the correct size. 2) Because these are nylon, the ends of each strap have very rough/sharp ends.  I imagined that this would be very uncomfortable for our pups... especially under they arms.  So, I spent time with a sturdy emery board and 'sanded' each end to eliminate the roughness.  I would think the company could address this before sending them to customers.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "04 16, 2013", "summary": "Finally a nice, durable harness..."}
