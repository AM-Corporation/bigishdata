I'm having the same problem with changing speeds that others have written about, but it is more an annoyance than a deal-breaker. It takes a little fiddling to get it to shift from low to high, but no more than a couple of seconds worth. The impact driver is a fine little tool. It starts the screw fast before the impact kicks in (compared to a battery drill on low speed), but after driving a few screws I got used to it. It puts 3 1/2\" screws into treated pine effortlessly. The driver is light enough to hang on my tool belt without hardly noticing it's there. The battery level light is handy as well. I would say this was money very well spent.2014 edit: four years later, hours of use, still going strong. Batteries still hold charge just fine. Drill is showing some wear, but still does the job.

I'm not the handiest of people by nature, but I have done my share of DIY projects, including aLithonia 2-head LED Security Light Motion-sensing Flood Light/floodlight Commercial/home Super Brightjust a few months ago (which was a piece of cake, and can't say enough good things about that light!).  This was a PIA from the get-go.  To start, there was a bad screw from Lithonia (I had to use myAlden 8440P Pro Grabit Broken Bolt and Damaged Screw Extractor 4 Piece Kitjust to get the faceplate screw out so I could do step 1!!!) and - at the end of it - I wasn't sure it was working (it is).  There's a photocell that's designed to stop this from turning on in daylight that makes it difficult to test until that night!Things were made harder by the fact that this was an eave mount: having the light upside down makes things a whole lot harder!  For one, screws kept falling out...  Wall mounts will be easier, I suspect.On the plus side, since I ended up calling support, I do have to say the lady was very nice and quite helpful.Other things that made this a challenging installation on my eave:1) Mounting screws were all wrong.2) It's quite heavy, since the bulb units are in it3) There's a front and a back (or an up and a down) since the photocell is only on one side.  This isn't quite clear when you're assembling the whole thing4) It's REALLY tough to see the recessed screws and the backplate connections.5) The wires are aluminum, so you might needIdeal Industries 30-065 A/Cu Wire Connector NutBut now that it's installed...  I'm growing to like it more.  The lights are BRIGHT white as anything to stare at, but don't really help in the golden yellow light of dusk or dawn.  On the other hand, in the middle of the night, my backyard patio is fully illuminated.  The 2-head light by the same firm is half the price and I think illuminates WAY better because of the diffusers.  Also, each head here is a little weaker: while the total number of lumens here is more than the other (2067 vs 1700), this one needs three heads to do it, so on a per head basis, the other is 850 per head to this one's 689.", "overall": 3.0, "reviewTime": "03 25, 2014", "summary": "Very challenging installation"}

The only other contenders for this title are possibly the Delta 36-136, the Trojan MS-2000, the Trojan TWC-35, and the Ridgid MS-UV.  So what makes the Bosch better than the also-rans?  Let me tell you:Delta 36-136 - This is a nice stand, but it was not sufficiently stable for my saw.  In addition, the wheels were flimsy and prone to getting stuck in mud.Ridgid MS-UV - This stand is good, however it does not setup as quickly as the Bosch, and storing a heavy saw on this stand when it is folded up takes up a lot of space.Trojan MS2000 - This stand is basically the Ridgid MS-UV on steroids, and is the closest contender to the Bosch.  It is heavy duty, but it does not set up as quickly as the Bosch, and it has the same storage issues as the Ridgid.Trojan TWC35 - This stand isn't a cart stand, so it isn't as portable, however, it is the sturdiest and most heavy duty of the stands.  If speed, elbow grease and storage space aren't issues, then it beats everything else.Bosch T4B - It's tougher than everything but the Trojan TWC35.  It sets up and breaks down faster than anything else out there.  You can store the whole system in the upright folded position, so it saves space.  It has great wheels, and a quick disconnect feature to remove the saw from the stand.  The only negative thing I can say about it is that it's made in China.*****Update (3/26/2009)*****I've had it about a year, and it's still going strong.  The only maintenance it has required is that I had to air up the tires.  One thing I haven't done yet but would recommend doing is considering replacing the inflatable rubber wheels with flat-free wheels.

The scraper (or whatever they call it) is a little awkward to use but it does extend my reach so fewer moves of the ladder to get the leaves to me and out of the gutter.  It is pretty awkward close up so I end up using my hand to help get the leaves into the scoop.  The scoop is the real star of the show though, it gets a lot of leaves at once.I also like the Big Top downspout strainers.  I had actually gotten a few of these before and liked them so the included pair was a bonus.  I ended up getting more of them so I could put them on all my downspouts.  They will ultimately make up for the other slight deficiency of this kit - it doesn't provide any help for getting stuff out of the top of a clogged downspout. I resorted to my old standby - the curly end of a disassembled wire hanger - I just clear a bit of an opening and let water from the gutter clear the rest of the clog out.

It doesn't remove lead, mercury, or any other contaminants. A 5 micron filter will let water parasites, bacteria, cryptosporidium, giardia, pass through the pores.This fits in my GE SmartWater undersink water filtration system. I live in NYC where the water is reasonably clean (if I'm to believe the city's published water quality reports). For drinking water, I'll still use myPUR 2-Stage Water Pitcher Replacement Filter, 4-Pack. The stated duration of this product is 3 months but that, of course, depends on how much water you run through the system.

The right hand pointer finger is not sewn correctly.  It twists so that at the top of the finger the seam is on the finger rather than along side the finger.  That seam will not last.  To add insult to injury these are huge!  I ordered a size small & a size small is what arrived.  I can wear another pair of gloves inside these gloves!  That is how big they are!  On top of that despite having a pair of gloves under this pair, the fingers are still too long & the gloves slide down my hand to my wrist making matters worse.  The elastic around the wrist is a joke.  Without the pair of gloves under these gloves the elastic hangs around my wrist, it doesn't even grip it.  It barely grips with another pair of gloves underneath.  I can literally bend the tips of the finger down they are so long.  The pinkie finger is crazy long.  They have padding but it could be a lot better.  I am going to save these for Winter use since I can fit gloves for warmth underneath.  Wearing them is uncomfortable due to the long fingers & constant need to pull the gloves up.  I don't want to use them, but I don't want to throw them out either.  I doubt they will hold up past one Winter so at least I wont have to suffer them too long.I was going to rate these 1 star, but they are better (for padding) then the Mechanics Wear brand which are ultra thin, too big & don't last.  So these are just barely better than them.  I just ordered another pair of Youngstown gloves.  I know they will wear out but at least they fit & have excellent padding & features geared towards women!  So far they are the best work gloves I have found.  I do a lot of hard work & my hand are very slender & small.

Each bank is connected its own single pole dimmer switch and the two switches are right next to each other - in a corner nowhere near the couch or the stairs to head to bed.I chose to buy these switches for a few reasons:-My prior dimmers wouldn't hold a consistent brightness level-A dimmer switch with this level of functionality without the remote typically sells for about 2/3 of the price of these, so it was very little to pay for the \"cool\" factor and convenience-These are typically the last bright lights I shut off before I go to bed and it can make for a dark walk. I keep one of the remotes in that direction-I have a Logitech Harmony remote (any universal IR remote may work if programmed correctly)Other reviews have stated that if you have two switches next to each other, don't by the IR, by the RF version of these switches. That way you can control them independently. I decided to go with the IR, as I actually saw it as a benefit - here's why:-You can turn both on and off or dim simultaniously-Compatible with IR universal remotes-If you're sneaky, you can get the *majority* of configurations between two sets of lights. Since this switch has a \"favorite\" setting you can set your \"favorites\" as one of the dimmers being on and all the way up and the other being completely off. From there, if you dim the one that is on it remains the only light on, just dimmer. You can also brighten the one that is off without affecting the one that is already on, and then also dim both down.These switches met all of my expectations. Most importantly, they offer excellent and solid control of my LED lights - although I will caveat that the EcoSmart brand has been known to be more dimmer friendly than some others.One final note: these also come with a very nice wall plate, which is a nice bonus if you have an independent switch.

If you know Pepper Trees, they tend to sprout out like a giant octopus and can have many trunks--some up to two feet in diameter.While I began with the smaller trees it wasn't long before I stepped it up and went for the big boys.  I never would have anticipated being able to cut through a two foot diameter tree with a bow saw, but the BAHCO almost made it easy.  You can use it either one or two handed and it simply continues to bite its way through the tree.  By the way, try to avoid checking how sharp the blade is by running your fingers over it. The blade is so sharp that you're bound to cut yourself with it.Normally I would use a chain saw to cut them down but my wetlands are so thick that I didn't feel safe using one in that environment.  The other potential problem is that Pepper Trees, because of how they grow, can snap back and jump off the stump depending on how the tree's weight is distributed and what other vegetation might be holding up the tree.So on the big ones I only cut about 95% of the way through and let the wind do the rest.

The body and blade are very well made and feel really high end (especially since this knife is not that expensive compared to some).  The blade is sharp and cuts through most things with no problem, and the saw teeth at the bottom are super sharp and great for sawing.  The locking mechanism works perfectly for me (I have had no problem), just open the blade all the way and the piece in the handle pops inward to keep the blade out, than just push it to the side with your thumb and shut the blade.  I have not had an issue (if you do not push the blade open all the way it does not engage, but that is true of any knife).  The handle is nice (slick feeling, which is misleading since it looks like it would have a good grip), but the way the knife's handle is made it easily allows your hand to hold it tightly since it has finger grooves.  The blade is a good size and when shut fits nicely in your pocket or in a bag (I use it for keeping a knife on me when going for a long bike ride or hike, since you never know when you will need to a tool, and a knife is about the most useful tool).  The blade is sharp and can cut easily and it is well made so you can also use it for semi leverage (I would not put too much force as a lever, but it is useful when trying to get something open).In the end this is a nice looking knife, that is well made and works perfectly.  The blade is sharp and saw teeth get the job done.  The knife works perfectly and I have not had any issue, it is a great utility knife when out and about and has a good feel to it!", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "03 4, 2014", "summary": "Works great and feel well made"}

It smells like a swimming pool and is very hard.I purchased this unit from Costco not Amazon.  When I pulled it out of the box I started to think that it was going to be complicated to install.  The well written directions made it easy to install the unit.  All of the connections except for the water supply are quick connect which are secure and easy to make.After the unit was installed and I opened up the water supply I could hear the water gurgling and the waste of the RO running down the drain.  The directions call for draining the first tank of water which I did.  The second tank that we sampled was the best water I've ever had from home. It is far better than a Britta pitcher.  It has a crisp, clean taste without any chlorine smell.I let my kids sample the difference by trying 2 cups, one from the faucet, one from the filter.  My 9 year old son didn't even need to drink to tell the difference.  Once he took a taste of the unfiltered tap water, he pushed it away and said it was horrible. He hung on to the filtered water.Now we can refill reusable bottles and I don't have to haul cases of bottled water home.  It is better for the environment and much cheaper.  We are drinking more water rather than soda because it tastes good and is easy to get to.Another added benefit is that I put a tee in the connection as the instruction described and routed the water to my Samsung Fridge.  The Samsung water filters cost about $40 plus shipping from Amazon.  Now I can stop buying these filters every six months.  The quality of the water from the Watts filter is much better than the Samsung filter.The only negative part of the install is that the storage tank takes up a fair space under the sink.  The directions say that you can put the filter/storage up to 25 feet away with 1/4 inch line or further with a 3/8's line.  In reality the space under the sink was taken up with a bunch of junk that we never used and having good water at the sink is a much better use of the space.UPDATE 4-10: Someone contacted me through my Samsung fridge filter review and pointed out to me that Reverse Osmosis can waste a high ratio (1:3) to (1:5) of water make its final product.  You can hear the water running down the drain after you use the faucet.  The sound bothers my wife so I put the drain plug in as a mute.

I still prefer my DeWalt for the smaller jobs simply because this Bosch is a huge monster of a sander and gets you tired pretty quickly if you're having to support it. But the Bosch is a great go-to for finishing off the larger projects where a belt sander isn't a great option.The slide and clamp-locking system for the sanding sheets was very intuitive and easy to use. Having only used belts or velcro-backed sanding sheets, I was unsure of how to keep the sandpaper taut. The clamping system made it very easy to align the suction holes and keep the sheet nice and tight. The Bosch is compatible with adhesive sheets and includes a simple plastic punch plate to open up the air holes. It also doubles as a storage stand (I assume).What's in the box is pretty basic - the sander, the grip attachment, attachable dust bag, and vacuum tube adapter. As another reviewer mentioned, there is no case, but that wasn't much of an issue for me as only my DeWalt sander came with one. All-in-all, it's a sander.  So far so good. Good power, good suction, feels nice and solid, and has a nice long cord to reach all the corners.

It's about the same sound level as a standard bathroom fan. It actually sounds like it would move a lot of air, but it doesn't.The fan's first test was during remodeling of the room to help clear out plaster dust after I skim coated and sanded the walls. The room was sealed off and while it did eventually clear out, it took a long time and most of the dust just settled to the floor.The second test was to light a cigarette and see if the smoke was pulled up toward the vent. The smoke just rose up as normal and didn't seem to be moving in the direction of the vent at all. Only when the cigarette was held just inches below the vent did the fan pull the smoke out. Seeing this I doubt that the fan would be much help in circulating any warm air out of the room.The fan was inexpensive so not too much lost but I will probably have to go with something bigger and more powerful.

It's not a SureFire, but it's a nice light for the price.Decent build quality, doesn't rattle, decent light distribution.  Comparing it directly to a SureFire E2L Outdoorsman, the first thing to note is that the Fenix beam pattern is much brighter in a smaller center, with a very distinct outer circle that is much wider.  The SureFire has a much more uniform beam distribution with a wider center and softer edges (much better light distribution)I bought this specifically for use at work where I use AA batteries in all devices (laser range finders, flashlights, cameras, etc), so I wanted an affordable \"beater\" flashlight that runs on AA batteries.  This flashlight does that perfectly.  I've only had it a few weeks, so I can't vouch for the long term durability, but it appears to be well-built.There isn't a significant difference between low and high beam settings, so don't pick it for the two light levels.  When you turn on the light with the tailcap pushbutton, it comes on in low power unless you twist the lens head and then it goes to higher power (noticably brighter but not a huge difference).  By comparison, the SureFire is almost like two flashlights (somewhat dim and then way brighter when you shift to high power).Bonus - it has a tailcap lanyard, which is nice in the field.  I wrap it around my wrist and am less likely to lose the light.  It also comes with a spare pushbotton rubber cover and a spare set of gaskets.Downside - the case is round and the light can easily roll away if you put it on an inclined surface.In summary, it's not a SureFire but just the fact that it compares to a SureFire is a plus.  Definitely not total junk.  I spent $32 on the Fenix and $120 on my SureFire.Extra bonus - the comic value of reading the poorly translated user manual.Update - it died on me - bad switch.  I eventually contacted Fenix, and the lady told me in broken english to clean the switch.  Not much help.  I don't think I'll be buying one of these again.

The embedded LED lightbulbs are very small and unobtrusive, yet they are very bright. The 120 lightbulbs are strung together on a 20 ft long thin double copper wire that is lacquered but otherwise looks exposed. At first the idea of using what looked like a long exposed copper wire for decoration seemed odd and tacky, but when I put it on my front porch patio and turned on the lights I could immediately see that we had a winner. The lights were glimmering with crisp white color that very nicely matched the surrounding wire. They really work well in conjunction with each other.The advantages of using a solid copper wire instead of a regular electric connecting wire are numerous. Copper wire is very flexible, and yet it can be put into a fixed shape of one&#8217;s choosing. It can rigidly adhere to any structure or constraint that one puts it onto, and is thus very pliable and can serve many creative purposes. The lacquered finish also ensures that the lights can be used outdoors, and the solar panel power source lets you keep these lights on the year round. I&#8217;ve put these lights up for this year&#8217;s Christmas decoration, but I am seriously considering keeping them around for decorative purposes year round. These lights really add charm and character to your home's outdoors decorations. I would just recommend that you put them somewhere where they can be exposed to a lot of sunlight during the daytime hours.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "03 4, 2014", "summary": "Simple and Effective Decorative Lights"}

I use this for taking my dogs outside when it's dark so I can watch where I step... there are no street lights where we live, and the ground is rather rough because of the moles that tunnel everywhere.  Works great, I wish I'd gotten this flashlight sooner.My flashlight arrived with AAA batteries already installed in it so I didn't have to use my own right away.  If there are any longevity issues with this flashlight, I'll be sure to update.The only downside so far?  The detachable lanyard is too small.  I'm guessing it's to be used as a wrist strap?  I have small/medium size slender hands.  The wrist lanyard is not a stretchy cord, and my hand can barely get through that wrist strap loop.  The lanyard cord is melted or glued together at the ends - I've only tried twice to use the lanyard and already the melted/glued part has pulled halfway apart.  If I try to use the lanyard a couple more times (and when I'm using this flashlight, I'll try to pull the strap over my hand, without thinking about it), the lanyard loop is bound to break completely.

I was faced with trying to sweet talk Makita into about seventy dollars worth of replacement parts, but decided to just return and order a new one. Note that the warehouse deal only refunds upon return, no replacements.To Amazon's credit, the new compressor arrived two days later. If I had it to do over, I probably wouldn't go with the warehouse deal because the savings of only twenty plus dollars versus the hassle if things go wrong just isn't worth it (but that's just me). Also, I'm not sure that the warehouse looks their returns over that carefully. The broken one I received looks great, but might have been returned in that broken condition. The damage only became apparent after filling the crankcase with oil and starting up for the twenty minute break-in period. The sound of air escaping was not from the open drain valve, but from the fracture hidden in the check valve's threaded input end.As for the new compressor, very sweet indeed. Over the years, I have owned literally dozens of compressors of all types. Some purchased, some rebuilt from badly worn, some put together from parts and pieces. This little fella is very quiet, truly efficient, seems very well made, quite compact for easy storage, and while certainly not a lightweight, is indeed portable (I'm in my mid seventies).

I needed something that safely insulates. I'd tried electrical tape but it didn't hold firmly to secure the pieces together. This product is precisely what I was looking for, and I am surprised the electronic store clerk looked at me like I was crazy because they certainly should be selling the stuff.I actually had three computer and video cables that had pulled out of their casings from the plug now with a little wire exposed. It was either repair or replace, and replacing the three would have been much more expensive than using this stuff. There are eight mini packets in this package and one was enough of the material to repair them all. So, although the price seems a bit high, depending on the application, the material can be sufficient to make numerous repairs.This product also provided a solution for another small problem that seemed to have no acceptable resolution. There is a large expansion joint in the concrete floor of my garage. It is stable, but it dips so low that the gasket on the garage door doesn't block it. So, snow and rain can get in at that spot. Imagine a U shape that is approximately three-quarters of an inch across and an inch deep.The only solution I could think of entailed filling the entire length of the expansion joint from garage door to the wall with flexible concrete caulk, but since it wasn't cracked I was hesitant, both because it was unnecessary for what was only a small issue, and concerned that future potential buyers of the house might think there was a problem with that area since only that one expansion joint would be filled. I hoped to remedy the situation before winter weather arrives and this product provided the solution.I formed a small thin vertical dam that fit in the space, and situated it so the garage door gasket would sit on it, closing the gap. I mixed a white packet with a small amount of the black and created an almost invisible concrete grey color. The purpose of the repair is obvious to anyone noticing it, but the repair itself isn't immediately noticeable. Forming a vertical repair with caulk or concrete repair material would have been tricky, and messy, but this worked perfectly.This stuff is also clearly a great product for people with physical limitations that would make gripping things difficult, although it would improve anything with an uncomfortable grip. I have a screwdriver that is a favorite, but it has an edge encircling the handle that always seems to dig into a callous on my finger. A small flattened blob of this material fixed it. It is now customized for my hand.I am seriously impressed with this material, but since it has a six month shelf-life past its sell by date, it may be best to time the purchase so all of it can be utilized within that period.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "09 18, 2013", "summary": "Sugru Hardware Sealer"}

It was a delight to have the opportunity to test Sugru out for myself.This multi-pack has eight small packets. Each one would be enough for a small repair, such as a cable cover or maybe a small hook, but for many tasks you'd probably need multiple packets or the larger size. For what I did, though, one packet was perfect. I made two \"feet\" for my netbook base to raise the back a bit, allowing air to circulate and keep it cooler, since it has no fan. I saw a similar idea on the Sugru site's list of \"guides\". I rolled the Sugru into a long \"snake\", broke it in half and then rolled each half into a ball about the size of a grape. I then stuck each ball on the bottom of the netbook and pressed it down lightly against a dampened table (the water prevents the Sugru from sticking to the table. Then I turned it over and left it to cure overnight.The next day I had two firmly attached \"feet\" that not only lifted the back of the netbook but also provided some additional stability due to the resilience of the silicone. They were stuck on firmly, but should be removable in the future if I want.Applications for Sugru are limited only by your imagination - and wallet. As others have noted, the stuff ain't cheap.

Though, over time with many repeated washes the seams will come out around the web of the hand. Though, with the great price and the quanity you get these will last a long, long time.The only thing I don't like is that these liners are not hemmed at the bottom of the glove, as this causes fraying after a few washes.

But I'm about to do that very thing.Also, I'm going to compare it to a Kohler faucet (amazon product number B000MF882K, and looking at the picture of it may make what I say below more obvious) that I've had for a couple of years. This isn't going to be a con/pro review (because it's a nice faucet and I don't see any cons so much as I see \"are you sure this is what you want issues\"). So...1) This is an expensive faucet and while I haven't had it long enough to judge how it will hold up, it seems well made and the price suggests it should be. The finish is a nice lightly brushed stainless.2) I was used to the Kohler and I liked it. It's a similar idea: single handle control , and the head of the faucet pulls out to be used as a sprayer-on-a-hose. But a couple of differences that I notice (in two near-identical sinks): On this faucet, only the bigger head at the end pulls out and while that works OK, it seems more awkward to pull it toward me than on the Kohler, because it pulls downward, whereas on the Kohler the part that pulls out is the head and several inches of the neck, and it pulls out more horizontally (with openings stil pointing down), which provides a nice handle, and you are pulled the hose sort of straight out.2) Make sure that you don't have cabinets over the sink that are low enough that this might seem too tall. This isn't at all a criticism, and for most people it won't make a difference, but measure if you do.3) This is a slight criticism, though I'm not sure it's fair as the issue is clearly visible: The control knob being on the side (which is typical with these high, arching faucuts) means only using the right hand, and I've got friends that have faucets which this feature. I'm not wild about it, but what I notice with this model is that the handle seems smaller than others and I find it hard to adjust easily. To be fair, I'm a very tall guy with large hands.4) These type of faucets (with the sprayer built indo the machin faucet) tend to reduce the water pressure because the swivel capability of the head means that it uses an attachment with a small flow-through swivel area (I haven no idea what the correct terms are). However, this one seems to be less affected by that than the Kohler, which is nice.All in all, I like this faucet. I hope it's well made and at roughly $350 as I type this, it should be. I'll report back after I've had it longer.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "07 23, 2013", "summary": "Lovely faucet, but a couple of things to think about"}

After getting the quote for staining the siding and eaves ($10k) I decided to save some money and stain the siding myself.  How hard can it be, right?  After scrubbing the siding with a little wood brightener (a must-do for cedar siding), and taping off the windows and trim, I started applying stain with a brush.  Ten hours later, I had completed about 15% of my siding.  Wow, only 85% more to go.  Looks like I'm not going anywhere on vacation this summer.  In addition to the time, my arms and shoulders were fatigued and I certainly didn't relish the thought of doing the same thing the next day.  I immediately went inside, started researching sprayers, and settled on this unit.The unit is very easy to set up.  It takes less than a minute and requires no tools.  I can't speak to how the unit works with latex paint, but it works like a dream with stain.  You have to spend a little more time taping and masking EVERYTHING that will be near the sprayer.  The overspray is pretty well constrained by the unit but you will definitely get a little spray that misses your target area.  Taping and masking is a must!  Don't expect to just put a 2\" piece of painters tape on the edge of the trim closest to the siding.  You will have to cover the entire window AND seal the edges with tape.  If you have any prize-winning azaleas in front of your house, cover those too.  That being said, once your done taping/masking, the actual spraying takes about 1/5 to 1/10 of the time that a brush takes.  And it is sooooo much more fun than using a brush.  AND SOOOOO much less fatiguing than using a brush.  There's no pushing stain into corners or going over the same spot 3 times with a brush.  The sprayer just lays down the stain.  You WILL have to back brush a little.  This means that you will spray on the stain to saturation and smooth the stain into wood with brush. It fixes the inevitable drips, puddling, sags, etc.  It sound like you're doing twice the work but trust me, you're not.  SMOOTHING out stain with a brush takes about 1/10 of the effort and time as APPLYING stain with a brush.The paint/stain container used on the sprayer seems small when you look at it and it does empty out fairly quickly.  The reason it empties out quickly is because you coat so much of your project so fast that OF COURSE its going to empty out quickly.  The reason a gallon of paint/stain seems to last longer when you're using a brush is because you aren't moving fast enough to use much.  My only (very minor) complaint is that the hose did pop out a few times.  No big deal, it pops right back in and doesn't hurt anything in the process.In my opinion, clean up takes the same time as using a brush.  Unless you're using disposable brushes and just throwing them away at the end of the day, you have to clean your brush just like you have to clean this sprayer.  For the oil-based stain I was using, I simply saturated a paper towel in mineral spirits and wiped down the machine.  After that I emptied the remaining stain from the sprayer's container back into the can and filled the container about 1/3 full with mineral spirits.  After vigorously swishing the container, I turned on the sprayer until the spray ran clear.  Finally, I took apart the spray head (by hand, no tools necessary, takes about 10 seconds) and put them in some more mineral spirits.  After wiping down the parts, I put humpty-dumpty back together and shoved him in his box.One last thing (and remember, I can only speak to using stain with this sprayer), no thinning was required.  I just poured the stain directly into the container, attached it to the unit, and away I went.

The overall construction of the TK35 is very well done with tight fitting screw threads, a fairly solid feeling battery holder and drop-proof sturdiness (already dropped it onto the hard tile floor). I have not invested in the rechargeable batteries yet so I am using CR123's since I them on hand for other lights. Battery loading into the holder is fairly easy and the holder only fits into the body of the light one way to avoid reverse polarity which is a nice feature.For output comparisons, I used a Fenix P2D (180 lumens), Fenix TK10 (190 lumens), Life-gear 3-Cree (360 lumens), and a Terralux 4-D Maglight upgrade (600 lumens). I mainly focused on comparing the TK35's turbo mode with the brightest modes available in the aforementioned lights and the TK35 clearly outshines all of them. I used to think the Terralux 600 lumen output was unparalleled but disliked the physical size of a 4-D light and I now have a light that fits in the palm of my hand with more output! The output of the TK35 is fairly even with no significant rings or dark spots that I can notice. I do notice that the output color temperature of the TK35 differs from other Fenix LED lights. The TK35 I received outputs a \"warmer\" slightly yellower light than the other Fenix lights I own which has more pure white outputs. This is not a problem, I just got used to seeing pure white outputs so I was not used to seeing the warmer/yellower output of the 35. This might just be a personal preference as the output is so much brighter and the warmer light actually gives things a more natural look.My only main complaint is with the size and shape of the TK35. The round head seems to make it head-heavy even with batteries loaded and while not a problem, the rectangular/skinnier main body where you grasp and hold the unit is a little awkward compared to a circular/tubular light. I suggest using the included lanyard as I have already dropped the unit trying to operate the rear switches with one hand. Again, this is probably just personal preference and the light as a whole is an awesome performer. I just can't wait to use it longer and in real-outdoor situations.

This tool was made in the USA but did not receive the same attention to detail that I have come to expect from past purchases. That's the reason for knocking it down one star. They will work fine but for those tool aficionados out there I will try to give an honest report. The first flaw I noted was that the jaws do not line up. Mine were offset by 1/16\". I think this is a big concern since the pliers are designed for ignition work that require precision & misaligned jaws do not fit in this category. There is no way to permanently correct this flaw since the pliers are riveted together instead of the former nut & bolt method so you can't adjust or tighten them to correct the problem, Closer tolerance machining would fix the problem. I can force the jaws to line up by slightly twisting the grips in my hand but I don't think I should have to do this. They should line up naturally when closed. The next flaw on my purchase was the rubberized coating on the handles did not fully cover the the ends. You can clearly see the metal underneath. It almost looks like it could have used one or more dips in the hot blue handle coating tank. The final flaw was the machining on the side of the metal jaw. It was sloppy at best with visible imperfections. I ran my pair across my wire wheel and applied a fresh coating of clear lacquer to dress up their appearance. Bear in mind that tools are individually crafted and you could get a pair that is perfect but I am stating the condition that mine arrived in. If purchasing from a brick and mortar store I would have passed this pair and pulled another one off the rack from behind. I did find the handles a little skinny making them uncomfortable to hold compared to the Irwin model that is approx half the price.

I must be crazy. Well we'll see.It has a nice color balance and good dispersion But two things are not as advertised. First it is definitely not as bright as a sixty watt incandescent - more like a forty. Secondly it is not instant on like an incandescent. It comes on instantly at about half power and then goes to full brightness after a second or two. It's good enough that I would replace all my incandescents except for the price.I have a light just above my front door that I leave on all the time. It is in a fixture so I have always used indoor bulbs. The fixture takes an incandescent well but I had tried an LED before and it wouldn't fit. I have also used the compact fluorescents. At my electricity rate it's easy to calculate that this six watt LED will pay for itself compared to a sixty watt incandescent in about a year. Now that I see that it's more like a 40 than a 60 I guess it will take a year and a half. If this super expensive bulb fails before a year and a half I won't feel too smart. We'll see.At this price it makes sense near my front door but nowhere else. I have fluorescents in the kitchen, halogens in the bathroom and a decorative incandescent in the dining room. I have a couple incandescents here and there and a couple compact fluorescents but none of them is on for many hours a day. At it's present price this bulb would take decades to amortize it's initial expense through electricity savings except in my one always on front door fixture.Most of the people who have bought these so far I suspect are environmental wackos making a some kind of statement. I'm a bit more rational.The biggest benefit it has to deliver for me is lower hospital bills. I have to climb up a ladder to change this bulb. When I do this I risk falling off. I've never fallen off the ladder changing that bulb before but I have fallen while painting the garage. I'm nearing seventy and and 300 pounds. I don't need that kind of excitement anymore.If this bulb lasts as long as I hope, I will have saved maybe a dozen trips up that ladder - that's worth forty seven dollars.", "overall": 3.0, "reviewTime": "09 21, 2010", "summary": "About as Bright as a 40 Watt Incandescent"}

I had never routed anything before, and wanted to get a tool that would be a reasonable size and not too much of an investment in case I never got much future use out of it.  I wasn't sure how much power I'd need to do things like 3/8&#34; round overs.  I bought this one because the all metal base seemed to possibly be stiffer than some of the larger and more powerful routers in the stores, that had plastic bases (granted the bases also were larger).Ive found that this unit has more than enough power to put a nice and consistent edge on a piece of hardwood (oak), and the system to set depth is fairly straightforward and easy to use.My only complaint, if I had to stretch for one, is that the base is a little small, so I did find myself inadvertently tilting the router a bit, and/or not having truly optimal contact with the workpiece.  My results still came out perfect, as I just went back and did it again.  I think that a few more cm of base area would possibly make a big difference, as might some kind of bullseye level to help ensure that Im certain the unit is flat on the workpiece.For $99, again, can't go wrong for doing any reasonable sized work.  If I was doing a big project or needed more intricate work, Id consider a larger unit with a table, like the &#62;$200 Bosch units.

I still had one strip left, fortunately, since once they come off the wall, they won't restick.  For my second attempt I used a level to make sure that I got it straight since, unlike a nail or thumb tacks, it's more difficult to make small adjustments with these strips.  Got it straight, and the board has been hanging steady for about three weeks now.  Very nice.  Worked so well that I decided to buy a second, identical board for our game room to keep score on.

So you will need to look at your individual situation and possibly go for the larger strips if you have a heavier item or a more slick surface.  Nice alternative to nails, but you have one shot at getting the strip to stick.  If it comes off, it is used up and you are out a strip.  That makes this solution a bit expensive.

A few minor design tweaks and a longer cord would make this thing just about perfect.In the end, the price seems a bit high, but I feel the warranty allays any concerns that you may have.

It runs on three AAA batteries, which is a problematic amount (two would be better, as these are often sold in four-packs), but since the flashlight comes with two sets of batteries to begin with, and runs on said AAA batteries forever, I really can't complain.While the white LEDs are so bright that the light could be used as a 'stun-type' weapon, the red LED bulb is just about right for seeing in the dark in a gentle, general way. Inside a tent, I use the red light as a lantern, standing the flashlight body up on one end.It's helpful that the buttons have a tactile difference so you can tell which is which in the dark. The red button for the red light is smooth. The black button for the white lights is scored, which you can feel by running a fingernail over it.I appreciate the feel of the flashlight, with its sturdy black anodized body, and a solid, balanced weight in my hand. I have small hands, so this flashlight feels about right for me. For larger hands, this might be considered too small.The body of the flashlight is scored for secure gripping, flat on the both ends, and has the light buttons up at the top/front of the barrel. There's a small keyring on the bottom. A black lanyard attaches to the ring, and there's a tiny carabiner for the far end. I clipped the carabiner through the back strap of the flashlight holster - this ensures I will always have the nylon holster handy.The holster itself is made of black nylon canvas with a Velcro'ed top flap and webbing belt loop.RECOMMENDATIONOverall, this is a very well-considered kit. You get the LED flashlight with two lighting options, batteries, an extra set of batteries, a holster, and a lanyard and carabiner, all together. I'm very happy with the sturdy feel, ease of use, and incredible brightness of this flashlight.I've seen these kind of tactical torches sold for outrageously high prices, and I can't imagine those lights are a whole lot better than this one.

All together I bought four of these.The quality of the flashlight is outstanding. I have a LedLenser I bought here on Amazon for over $100 (P7) and the LED flashlight that comes with this kit is 90% as bright as the P7. And that's not just my opinion, that's using a light meter bought here on amazon as well. The light is a nice bright white and as has a useful range of about 1/8 mile (660') (reflective range about double that.) The one down side is one of the LED flashlights had a defective battery holder, which was promptly replaced. The flashlights have a beam adjustment for range; short and wide or long and narrow or anything in between. At the long range, the light pattern is a perfect square. As you pull it back, it goes out to a round spot and the further you pull it back it goes to a wide flood. The switch goes low-off-high-off-high flashing-off. The high flashing mode is insanely effective if you want people to see you.Now the bike mount. It functions well, but I did have to use some old vinyl 7/8\" tubing to act as a spacer on my 22mm handle bars. Its pretty easy to adjust and goes up and down and left and right. You may also notice it's \"sloppy.\" If so, you pull out the little rubber pad and there is a screw in there that you can tighten to take up the slack. I had to tighten all 4 I bought.Now here is the problem. I bought 4 total, 2 of which broke. The seller is replacing both. One broke in the mail and one just broke on it's own. It was fine after a ride and then the next day I came out and it had snapped during the night. The problem is the plastic hinges seem to be a bit brittle. They broke right were the metal pin goes through them. It's really very thinly molded in that area. Two are still hanging in there and we'll see how the two new ones do. I strongly suggest only tightening the nut just enough to keep the mount from turning.I put two on each bike. One is focused long range and the other wide range. You can easily be seen a mile away, and with the two of them like I have them setup, close stuff is visible and long range is also very well lit at least out to 1/8th mile.Based on the price, (I paid $25 each) I don't see how you can go wrong. The flashlight is really equal to a $100 LedLenser P7 (okay 90%) and if the bike mounts hold up, then that's a bonus.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "02 25, 2010", "summary": "Awesome product, sorta."}

Of course using 1/2 inch shank bits that are extremely sharp probably help quite a bit towards that smooth operation.  Now that I have this router, and soon to own the Bosch router table as well, which is also invaluable, and the edge cutting/circle cutting guide too, I don't know how I survived without one before now.  You almost have to have someway to brace this tool when cutting straight lines or trying to follow a certain pattern.  Even though it cuts through the wood like a hot knife through butter, it's a very hard to keep if from wobbling.  Good example of this is:  it's alot like trying to hold a camera steady while zooming in close and keeping it steady without using a tripod, and that's a camera without the new autosteady feature that the new ones all have.

And at about 11 years old, the connector started leaking and the head itself was looking rather hit, so it was time to replace it.My first thought was to buy another Waterpik, but at nearly twice the price, I decided to give the Peerless a shot. Thanks in no small part to the reviews here (and video!) I will say, I was hesitant about the removable head not having as many settings as my Waterpik. It wasn't until I had this installed that I was sure I had a keeper.It's a shower head, so you don't need to be a plumber to install it. Have anadjustable wrench? You're good to go. Have someteflon tape? Even better! The instructions were straightforward, and the project took all of about five minutes to complete.Once I turned it on, I was really surprised by the amount of water flow. Set to \"both\", this thing will drench you! Removing the head and replacing it is really easy and can be accomplished without blocking the nozzles and spraying water all over the place. Initially, I thought my reservations had been justified with the few settings on the removable head, but being able to have the fixed shower head going while using the removable head is so great, I don't care that it only has four settings. That pretty much sealed the deal right there.\"Why only four stars, then?\" you ask? The overall design can really be improved. You have chrome going to brown plastic, back to chrome, back to brown plastic, and turquoise nozzles. I love the 80's as much as anyone, but I'm not all excited about stepping back in time when I take a shower. I didn't think it would bother me much when I bought it, but it really is kind of atrocious after having used it for about a month.I like the shower head too much to replace it, but if Peerless came out with an all-chrome model, I'd buy it in a heartbeat and give this to a friend.

One hole would require me putting all my weight on the drill for about 10 minutes as it vibrated my wrists. Of course spade drills are designed for mixing wet mud, not drilling into hardened mud. And it would make the drill hot.I got tired of abusing my big mixing drills, and my wrists like that, so I got this Bosch SDS. I got it factory reconditioned from CPO. I could not tell it had been used other than the box was open. It drilled the same hole my spade drill took 10 minutes to do in 15 seconds.I've run this drill for hours doing nothing but 1/2\" rebar holes and it doesn't get hot, just keeps going. No problems yet after a few buildings.SDS stands for slotted drive system. It uses a special kind of drill bit. Normal bits will not work without an adapter which I cover in the next paragraph. Basically you click a bit on, and the chuck locks it in place. Then only the bit is impacted in the chuck, instead of the entire chuck being impacted. Or to put it another way, only the bit moves while the chuck stays in place. This makes it a more efficient transmission of power, which is why SDS drills are all more powerful than traditional hammer-drills. Traditional hammer-drill chucks have more weight they need to move up and down.The drill has three settings. Drill only. Impact only. And drill and impact, like all SDS drills. And like all SDS drills the handle has vibration absorption. I won't lie and say Dewalt or Milwaukee are better or worse, I think those 3 brands stand hand-in-hand at the top, with Hilti standing above them, but also with a price tag twice as high.Since SDS drills are built to take abuse and high torque applications, they are also great candidates to use a hole saw with. But to use a hole saw you will need to buy theBosch 1618571014 SDS-plus Shank 3 Jaw Chuck with Integral. That \"traditional\" chuck will basically lock into the SDS chuck, so you will have two chucks doubled up. But then you can also use any other normal drill bit. Keep in mind if you have lots of smooth-shank-masonry-drill bits that you will need this chuck adapter if you want them to work in any SDS drill. And those traditional bits will not work as well as SDS bits, because then the drill has to move an entire chuck, just like traditional hammer drills.SDS max is not compatible with SDS+, MAX is basically for demolition and massive boring jobs. SDS plus and SDS+ is the same thing and is compilable with SDS.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "02 21, 2012", "summary": "Goes through concrete as easy as pushing a bit into sand."}

It is really strong, and has the eye relief of the more expensive triplicates.  Eye relief, for those who do not know, is exactly what it sounds like...the ability of someone to view thru it for hours, without eyestrain and discomfort..If you are going to be using a Microscope or lens, pay attention to this..as it will inevitably be the most important option you will \"feel\" when using any tool of this type.Finally the Price cannot be beat.

When I received my first lock it did not work. When the motor engaged the deadbolt never turned so I assumed I received a defective unit and as always amazon.com was right there to replace the item with no delay. Much to my surprise and a little dismay the second lock I received did exactly the same thing so I thought to myself....maybe I'm juts doing it wrong. So first of all the lock looks sleek and when it works its exceptional and if I hadn't had this issue on installation I would have given the device 5 stars, which I will give to their support people.I decided after my second lock and subsequent failure of said lock I'd call the install help hotline and I spoke to a very nice agent (Christi I think her name was) who when hearing the lock knew exactly what the issue was and how to fix it and told me if I didnt mind to do a few steps she'd have me working in 10 to 15 minutes. A promise she kept quite well I might add. So I'm here to share with you what was wrong and how to fix it if you receive one of these issues.The Problem:The Agent told me during the first production run of this lock or so they found that one of two items was simply not pressed into place well enough as it had been done my hand and is now done my machine. So either the circuit board or the motor underneath it (in my case it was the motor) were not tightly into position.Tools required for the fix:A simple fillips-head screw driver.A good thumb for pressingYou time...about 15 minutes worth.The fix:I will put photos up in the product page (See Link Below) to go along with my fix instructions.http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/product-gallery/B00AGK9KOGStart by laying the inside housing face up with the lock handle down and removing the batteries. Then remove the 3 screws (two on the bottom and one in the middle) . Once the screws are out the circuit board assembly as a unit easily comes out. Hold the circuit board assembly with the board facing up and from right to left gently push the 4 clips (see pictures as the fourth is in the middle and not along the bottom edge) and swing the circuit board like you would opening a door. You will not need to disconnect the wiring harness. Once done simple push the motor (seep pictures) with your finger and you will most likely here and feel it click into place. Take a moment to manual turn the motor until the center gear (with the notch) is in the correct horizontal position with the notch up (see pictures). Once complete reverse the process of dis-assembly by swinging the circuit board closed and pushing the clips in left to right. Ensure the board is securely installed. Re-install the unit in the metal housing ensuring the notch is also facing up (see pictures). Insert the screws and reattach the device to the door.A reset is recommended once you have completed this. To reset the lock simply hold the Schlage Logo on the keypad while reconnecting the battery pack. you will know the reset is complete when the unit flashes the green check-mark twice on the keypad as well as inside the red alarm button will flash. Now you are ready to use the lock and you won't need to return it.I hope this helps anyone who receives a lock with this issue.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "05 15, 2013", "summary": "Here is how you fix this lock if it does not work on arrival."}

I have a small shop and needed to replace a small Craftsman table saw.  I wanted a cast iron top for the stability.  After looking at many saws and many different prices, I came across the TS350 at Lowes for $399,99.  I compared this to Amazon and discovered I could get it for #268.99 with the discounts being offered plus no shippoing and no tax.  Lowes refused to match the price although they had a big sign saying that they would.  I was pleased to be able to get a smaller table top.  My needs were for making small items and I dont plan to be in a commercial business of ripping large pieces of wood.  I did read the complaints about the small table top and wondered why anyone who wanted a large top would buy a smaller saw and then complain ablut it.  I read the directions through before assembly and had no problems with the assembly.  I was up and running in a very short time.  Read the directions and look at the pictures and you should have no problems.  If you cant assemble this saw from the instructions, you probably shouldnt be allowed to play with tools.  My only complaint is that it is pretty heavy and I got some help to set it upright when I was through with assembling the base and putting on the dust collector, but thats a good thing I think.  Very stable and a solid table saw for a small shop.  I was prepared to pay as much as 4 times the price I paid for this unit and am very pleased at getting a quality and very stable saw with a cast iron top  and a smaller footprint in my smaller shop.  It is a direct drive and not a pully drive so I dont know how that will effect me in the long run but there is nothing sticking out the back to bump into so I am glad about that so far.March 2007.  I wrote the original review in March of 2006 and so  have had this saw for a year.  I can agree with some others that there should be some sort of way to stop the blade when the saw is turned off.  It is extremely quiet and the blade continues to spin for quite a while.  I guess on a belt drive there is much drag and on the direct drive there is little.  I have had no problems with the power or the adjustments.  I do fumble around looking for the Off On switch.  I know its there somewhere.  I even took a magic marker and marked the table top where to find it but the mark soon rubbed off of the table top... If I could only make two recommendations, it would be to put a blade brake on the saw and put the power switch in an easier to spot to see or find, or to mark the top in some way as to let you know where to find it.  I know its there but still find that I back up a step and look to find it.  The plastic handles work fine but I dont like them.  When I come across a set of metal ones I will replace the flimsy feeling adjustment handles.  With that said, I still would buy it again.

The bite on a miniature fastener is simply not good in my experience, and the tool holder is often too big to allow me to use the bit.But this kit is an essential part of my belt toolage.

That is incorrect.  I just received this product and tested it - it only lasts for 5 seconds.  The light output is not bad - I would not call it super bright but for a night light its pretty good.  The Velcro strip provided is just about an inch in length and I have my doubts about whether it would hold up with 4 AA batteries installed and installed overhead (where I plan to install it), but since I have my own rolls of Velcro tape that is not an issue.After installing it overhead, I would NOT recommend that you attach Velcro to the battery cover (what seems to be the most logical placement since it is smack dab in the middle of the back) - the battery cover comes off quite easily without much pressure.  I initially placed two strips to fit into the battery cover and when testing to see what weight/pressure they would withstand, when tried pulling the unit from the Velcro, the unit came off quite easily with the battery cover stuck to the Velcro.  So I added two more Velcro strips above and below the battery cover.I have since replaced this with a Mr. Beams MB980 ceiling light, which not only lasts longer (30 seconds) but produces more light (100 lumens vs I would estimate 10-20 lumens, but then it uses 4 C batteries vs AA batteries in the Hipe).  I have repositioned the Hipe as a Hallway light and there it does quite well.  For walking in the Hallway, 5 seconds is ideal.  In addition the Hipe has a fairly long range in its sensor - a good 20 ft compared to 10-15 ft in other motion sensing battery powered lights I have tried.", "overall": 3.0, "reviewTime": "04 24, 2013", "summary": "Only stays on for 5 seconds after last motion is sensed"}

The Quick-LocK cord is really a nice feature ( if you wear out, cutor nick the cord - it can be replaced with no tools or housing disassembly ), the trigger is of good quality, the reversing switch can be toggled easily while one-handing the screw gun and has no sharp eges, and the 0-2500 rpm speed range is acceptable for many fastening applications, including self drilling/ TEK type screws into metal. This kit is a new offering so durability is not proven, but Milwaukee's reputation should alleviate most concerns. This kit is appropriately named a Remodeler's kit that will come in handy for a variety of applications on the job or around the house.

It is used at my second home since my primary home has a very nice Jet mini-lathe. The PSI lathe is considerably bigger, but seems about the same weight as the Jet. The PSI unit is cast iron and seems to work exceptionally well, considering that it was half the cost of the Jet machine. I have two concerns, however: (1) the drive head makes a \"clacking\" noise that makes me wonder if there is a bad bearing. I haven't had enough run time on it to find out the answer, but I did note that it has a very long warranty (either 2 or 3 years), so I am not going to worry about it very much. The second problem is that the ball-bearing tailstock squeals. I think this is due to the fact that when you turn a pen, it is on a metal mandrel that only contacts the tailstock on the center spur, and the squealing is from the outside ring being \"left behind\" as it rotates.  I went to Woodcraft and bought a 60-degree cone tailstock which works much better anyway, highly recommended.  The tool rest on this one is much better than the one with the Jet lathe, as the former is nice and smooth whil ethe latter seems very rough and will need a little \"tuning\" with a file.  Packaging was OK, but was in pretty bad shape by the time UPS got it to my house. Nothing missing, and the equipment itself was in perfect condition. I rated this a 4-star for the ominous noises, but I feel I can honestly say I would buy it again.

They are concentrated, easy to mix, and can be applied with a standard sprayer tank. The label says \"Where to use: Outdoors.\" And that pretty much sums it up. Although the label mentions lawns and landscapes, it's more versatile and can be used as a perimeter spray around your house. It will dry and leave a protective coating. It's not the type of thing that will kill insects immediately. But bugs will get it on their feet, and it will get into their system. So if you see ants walking across a dry area where it was sprayed, don't expect them to drop dead on contact. This spray can also be used on lawns and on vegetables if you follow the directions and wait the appropriate stated period before consumption.I can attest to the fact that this works, but I can't say whether it lasts as long as stated, since I'm obligated to review it within 30 days. However, I've used both Spectracide Termite and Carpenter Ant killer as well as their Bug Stop product, both of which last as long as claimed. All of these disrupt the central nervous system of insects, causing death.The others I mentioned use lambda-cyhalothrin. This product uses gamma-cyhalothrin, and the two are different isomers of the same chemical. Since the gamma form is a single stereoisomer that lacks the less active and inactive isomers in the other formulas, it should be effective at lower concentration levels. So I expect that in the long run this will prove to be at least as effective as the other formulas, and if not I will update this review. It's fair to say that when used as a perimeter spray, I haven't had any recurrence of indoor bugs after spraying with any of the formulations.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "05 27, 2014", "summary": "Effective"}

It helps living in a large metropolitan area, as numerous local stores sell professional-grade routers.1. This is the only mid-sized router I could find that is designed to be controllable with one hand, with quick access to the off/on switch using your right thumb.  (If you hold the router in your left hand, the switch won't be in the right place for your thumb.)  This is important to me, because when routing dovetails, I hold a vacuum hose in my left hand, and the router in my right hand, so a two-hands-needed router won't work.2. Router bits stay in the precise center of the base, even when bit depth is adjusted.  This may sound pretty basic, but this is the only (non-plunge) router I could find where this was true.  E.g., in ALL of the units I looked at where height adjusts via the motor assembly screwing into the base, the router bit shaft is hardly ever in the very center after you tighten the motor housing clamp.  While this may not be critical for most router applications, it is whenever using template guides.  E.g., to make dovetail joints or use door hinge templates.3. Router is relatively light and easy to handle.4. Model 5615-21 comes with a well-designed case and a clever built-in removable router base (click on customer photos above).  There is no need to remove the bit from the router - as it is protected from damage while sitting right side up on the base, either with the base in the case, or with the base removed from the case.  The case provides outstanding tool protection and has extra space around the tool for storage.  Model 5615-20 is JUST the router - no case and no router base.Soft-start was not important, although that would have been a nice plus.  In fact, fast stopping of the bit would have been even more useful - i.e., it takes several seconds for the bit to stop after switching the tool to off.I bought this router primarily to use with a Leigh 24\" dovetail jig, although it's used for other purposes.  It hasn't been used enough to testify to its longevity, but so far, it's just what the doctor ordered.  The micro-adjusting screw is perfect for doing dovetails or door hinge routing, where you're typically moving the bit in or out, but 1/100\" at a time.  As with any well-designed router, you can set it upside down, because nothing sticks out.Owning 5 routers of various types, I can assure you that there is no \"perfect\" router for all purposes.  For example, I use a 3 hp plunge unit in a large router table - it's soft-start and variable speed, with plenty of power for those super-large panel door cutters, and bit changing needs but ONE wrench from the table top - because the tool's drive shaft can be locked.  This Milwaukee unit needs TWO wrenches (included) to change bits; and while it's amazingly simple to insert or remove bits with the router sitting on a bench, that wouldn't be so if it was under a [router] table.  Besides, it would be underpowered and too high-speed (for large bits).The reviewer whose unit vibrated too much might have had a defective router - mine hardly vibrates at all.  If I sit my router flat on a bench (with no bit), and turn it on and let go, it just hums, doesn't wander at all - and runs smooth as silk, although it's hardly quiet.Since through dovetails need two routers to be set up (for productivity), I'm thinking of buying another one of these...", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "10 2, 2005", "summary": "Terrific one-hand dove-tailing (and more) router"}

If you're looking to monitor your heart rate while running (or doing any type of exercise), this is not the device for you. For that reason alone I think it's misleadingly labelled and marketed a bit deceivingly (most of the pictures of people using this device show them running with it... but you have to hold completely still in order for it to take your heart rate). For that reason alone I have to give it only 2 stars. If this was marketed as a watch with heart rate monitoring capability I would give it four stars.With that out of the way, it is a nice watch. It's got an attractive design and is incredibly easy to set up and to use. The display is large and so are the numbers so it's easy to read. If you want to use it as a stopwatch or an alarm it handles that easily.It's the heart rate monitor part that's disappointing. When it does work it's great - it's convenient to get your heart rate whenever you want. But even sitting completely still I've found it to work only about 50% of the time, which is pretty frustrating. If you are moving (even walking slowly) it will not work at all and will flash to the heart rate monitor screen for a second before flashing back to the clock. To me that should prevent it from being called a heart rate monitor.", "overall": 2.0, "reviewTime": "09 30, 2011", "summary": "Misleadingly labelled, but it is a nice watch"}

So I replaced the silicone and covered it with this tape.  So far it has been pretty good and has reduced the sound of the burner substantially.As someone had described earlier, the glue does not stick once heated.  But like most metal tapes, you need to mold it to the shape of the pipe and so it stays pretty much were I wanted it to stay.  The ends will need some small wires wrapped around the flue to keep them in place.  Suffice it to say, using small pieces of this tape is not useful.  Longer runs are better, but around edges it tears easily so be careful.As far as the comment about the glue coming off, it sure does if you treat this tape like it blue masking tape.  You have to pull slowly and at the right angle.  If you feel or see it starting to break apart, change speeds or angle.  The glue doesn't know which side to stick to since it is metal tape and the same on both sides.The adhesive is not really good for 600degree and out gasses at this temperature.

I decided to go with this particular cat's paw after hearing some good things about the company and was even told by some people that it was the 2nd best cat's paw out there (Stiletto being the best, supposedly).  Well... I couldn't afford a Stiletto so I decided to give this guy a try.My use is mostly rough carpentry, including framing, trusses, and decking.  I'm mostly pulling 8d and 12d (a few 16d) nails, and the spacing on the two ends seems to be perfect for that.  I like how it grabs the nails but it lacks slightly in weight (I'd actually prefer it to be a little heavier) and it doesn't have a punch to dent the wood around the nails for a cleaner removal.  The punch (found on the Exhumer and the Stiletto) is only a minor flaw since I don't get bonus points for making the wood pretty in my uses.Overall, I'd rate this about equal to my Exhumer.  If they had babies and made a \"Sharumer\" (sounds German?), that would be a heck of a cat's paw.  Either way, I switch between this cat's paw and my Exhumer depending on what kind of mood I am in or whether I had a big lunch.Another benefit of this cat's paw is the finishing.  I've abused this cat's paw quite a bit already and the paint still hasn't chipped.  Once the paint starts chipping and I get some work in the rain, I'll let y'all know how it holds up.Pros:- Good grabbing skills- Lightweight- Nice finish and paintCons:- A little too lightweight for my likings- I wouldn't mind it being maybe 3/4\" longer, maybe- Nail punch to put dents around nails for clean removal", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "10 17, 2011", "summary": "From a Tool Snob"}

I must admit one of my favorite drills is an inexpensive lightweight Makita. The problem is that the drill bit doesn't really get grabbed well enough so the bit falls out. That is always a nuisance, but when you are up on a ladder it is more than that. My Milwaukee stopped that problem with carbide serrated teeth but it weighs a ton. Then along came this Bosch DDH181-01 and is a nice blend of all of that. It is lighter than the Milwaukee but even stronger.Fat pack high capacity batteries outperform standard lithium ions in the all important run time. Nothing like having to come down off of a ladder in order to have to change batteries.Clutch is so effective it is almost overkill. I expect a saw brake to stop a whirling blade but this Bosch DDH181-01 has the most aggressive clutch system I have ever seen. My Milwaukee brakes way better than my cheapy Makita but nothing like this Bosch. I guess if you need to do some rapid fire changing of bits repeatedly the instant stop of the rotating drill is nice.I am assuming that since this drill is selling for a little more in price than the Makita combo pack with a separate driver that the internals are built to last. I can see through the side vent window that the windings are solid copper unlike some of the cheaper drills using lesser metals. It's a tough drill which should provide years of regular use.The whole weight, power, comfort, convenience thing is moving in the right direction with this drill. It even comes with a smaller battery that shaves some weight off of the overall tool weight, and also includes a larger battery where power and longevity are of the utmost concern.The chuck may be aluminum on the outside to keep the weight down but the teeth internally are heavy steel and have a serrated double lip on them to keep drill bits in place. My Makita 6228D is a light weight drill but the teeth are smooth steel and lose grip way too easily causing the bit to drop out.Charging advantages with this Bosch have also come a long way with only a 30 minute recharge time. That alone is worth the price of admission. The batteries come with a 2 year protection plan with free replacements if they fail. That is more generous than the one year that comes with the Makita combo pack.The built in LED light is great for when you are working in dark quarters, or are outside finishing up a job right when the sun sets and you need just that little bit of extra light to finish up without dragging out the portable light setup.Another convenience item built in is the battery comes with a small on button on its heel so with a touch it illuminates one of three lights to tell you how much charge/capacity the battery has left. With the generous non-memory of a lithium ion battery that adds up to being able to take a partially charged battery and place it back in the charger and not have to worry about shortening the useable duration of the battery. So if you click the button and only see a single light, feel free to pop that one in the charger while you work with the fully charged one. With such a long battery life, and short recharge time you can easily get through the day without running short.This Bosch is the perfect blend of precision weight strength and function. Why do I say that? Because you can feather the trigger on this drill and it will move at a pace of one revolution per minute if you want (ok that is a little bit of an exaggeration but it moves so slow it is almost barely moving) so it you are setting a delicate screw you have that incredibly fine level of control, or you can set it at high speed and stand on the drill to get the brute force jobs done. So it is a precision piece of equipment. It is not usual to find this kind of strength and fine precision in one package.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "01 25, 2012", "summary": "Brute Force, Extra Long Battery Life, Moderate Weight, Long Guarantee"}

No luck there, certainly not from Black and Decker. I learned that the three 1.2 volt battery cells inside, which are soldered together with tabs to make a larger 3.6 volt battery pack, are called \"Sub C\". Further that they are a smaller size of \"Sub C\", so if you go looking for them, make sure you compare the originals with what you are going to buy. These are a little shorter than another kind of \"Sub C\".I ended up at a local store called Batteries Plus, where they carry the correct size Sub C (sold separately, not connected). Cost for 3 batteries was $14.50. (online prices for Sub C batteries are a bit lower but shipping makes total cost higher). Yes, I could have bought a new scissors for a little more than that, but I truly hate throwing good items away just because the manufacturer does not support them after the sale with something as simple as replacing a battery pack. I bought 3 batteries and merely taped them together. The solder tabs connecting between batteries on the original pack are not necessary, I found...I just put batteries end to end (like in a flashlight) and taped them together to form a pack. The original pack has a cardboard tube around it you can re-use to also help hold things together. I did remove the spade connectors from each end of the old pack and re-soldered them to my new pack. These tabs are needed to connect to the spade connectors/wiring inside the scissors. Total repair time after I had the batteries in hand: 30 minutes.I know this is more work than some people are going to want to do when their batteries die, but my scissors are now working again. Plus, I taught one of my kids how to solder. And how to fix something rather than throwing it in the trash when it stops working. In the future I'll weigh carefully any purchases of battery-powered devices from Black and Decker.Original review below:I've had these scissors for about 2.5 years, used maybe once every 2 weeks to cut paper in an office (not overused, in other words, but used regularly). It cuts well when working, but recently it stopped taking a charge. I looked at Black & Decker's website, and all parts for this scissor (and 2 similar models) are listed as \"unavailable\". There is no listing at all for a new battery at B&D;'s site under this product. Perhaps it's buried in their user-unfriendly website somewhere else but as there is no part number on the battery, nor even a description of what kind of battery it is (other than \"Type 1 3.6V\" on the outside of the scissors), it's kind of hard to search. Other reviewers here have stated the battery costs more than a new scissor (but not where they got a battery). Perhaps that's life in America today but I find it distressing that I'm supposed to just throw these scissors away and buy a new pair because B&D; cannot make the battery available nor sell it for less than the cost of a new scissors. I would suggest looking at other brands for your cutting needs which is what I'll likely be doing.

If you want an assisted-opening knife in the low 20s for dollars this is your knife.  If you are looking for a professional tactical knife suitable for police, fire, rescue, etc. professions, you'll need to spend more to get more.The parts:* 5Cr15Mov stainless steel.  Decent for the money.* 3\" hollow ground blade with drop-point with swage on top; it has a bit of poor jimping spine place where your thumb isn't.  It has an attractive satin (bead blasted?) finish.* Out of the box, it was as dull as cub-scout pocket knife -- wouldn't cut much of anything without using a sawing motion.* Nice, grippy but not grabby fiber reinforced nylon handles.  These are the best element of the knife.* It uses a liner-lock to hold the blade open which worked well.* The clip is also satin finish; very sturdy and shaped so that the knife rides deep in the pocket as I prefer.* The assisted opening is powered by a leaf spring and initiated by opening the knife using as with a conventional thumb stud.  In the resting position, the leaf spring is flexed so as to keep the knife closed.  With sufficient force on the thumb stud, the spring force is overcome and then reversed so that the blade is driven explosively over the first 60 degrees or so of opening, depending on momentum to carry it the remaining 120 degrees to the fully open position* There is also a patented \"Double-Lock\" capability that I think perhaps has some value in ensuring the blade does not spring open inadvertently (or close) inadvertently but which I don't believe is necessary in light of the active tension holding the blade in the closed position and the liner-lock which retains it in the open position.The sum:of the parts* The weight is right, while the size is a bit small for me, but I have large hands.* The blade opening is difficult at first, but gets easier with practice.  But practice does not change that it takes considerable pressure on the thumb stud to overcome the initial resistance (closing force) of the leaf spring.  Some reviewers indicate they simply can't open this knife one handed - I can believe it.* I feel like the explosive initial blade opening after which it coasts into the fully open position is more dangerous and less certain than a design which opens with less force but acting over the entire distance.* If your hands are strong but not large and if you want to own an assisted-opening blade without spending too much, consider the CX311.  If you are a professional looking for a professional-grade assisted opening knife, plan on paying 3 to 4 times this amount and getting a blade 3 or 4 times better suited to the task.", "overall": 3.0, "reviewTime": "09 22, 2013", "summary": "Coast RX311"}

(That's 50, 200 or 250 watts.)Each bulb lasts just about 1,500 hours--very good!Insert a new light bulb into the socket of the lamp (or whatever needs the light bulb) and screw it in until you feel that the bulb is snug and secure in the socket. Then turn on the lamp or whatever device you're using and--voil&agrave;! Your bulb works for the next 1,500 hours. That can be months if you're careful with your energy bill.The bulbs stay fresh for several months at least after you buy them; this is a great feature if you need to stock up on light bulbs for any reason. Obviously, these electric light bulbs must never go near water and or any other liquid. Dispose of them carefully so that any glass won't break and hurt anyone if they walk around barefoot in the house. If you have any additional questions, you should be able to go to the GE website for information or a way to contact the company directly.Just one thing: please remember, these are regular, incandescent light bulbs. They are not energy saving compact fluorescent light bulbs. If you need a CFL light bulb this is not it; you will have to keep looking--sorry!Overall, these \"three-way\" 50/200/250 watt light bulbs by GE fit the bill very nicely even if they don't truly have a \"medium light\" capacity. They are economical, easy to install and remove and they stay \"fresh\" for months after you purchase them. They take up very little room in any closet while you're waiting to use them, too.I highly recommend these light bulbs for any lamp or light fixture that uses bulbs of three strengths.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "06 18, 2008", "summary": "good light bulbs for three way light fixtures"}

Because of the gyroscope, there's no switch to determine the direction of spin. But it works great for all uses. There are no bits included, but you can use any 2&#34; or larger bit with a hex end. Build quality is excellent, similar to the typical Dewalt power tool quality. There are two LED lights at the front near the chuck that illuminate your task. Torque is also adjustable.Switching from the upright to a straight long tool is easy too. Press the two unlock buttons at the top, and turn the handle counter-clockwise. It only goes in one direction and locks into place.The unit comes in a nice bag, sized about 11&#34; W x 9&#34; D x 3&#34; H.  It's a medium-duty bag, with a single storage area, zippered, and no other pockets.  The battery charger base is 5&#34; W x 4&#34; D x 1.75&#34; H. The cord for the charger is 6 feet long. The screwdriver dimensions are 7&#34; front to back, 4.5&#34; tall, and 1.5&#34; wide.Two batteries are included (DCB080 Type 1 8V Battery Pack).  They charged in less than 45 minutes. You can keep the battery in the charger or in the screwdriver.  There is a lock switch under the trigger to keep the screwdriver from turning on accidentally. The lock switch is good, but I think it can be improved by making it slightly easier to lock into place.Setting and removing bits is easy. Push bits in and they lock in place. Pull the chuck forward to release the bit and pull the bit and release the chuck.  Preferably you want to use 2&#34; bits and longer. You can use 1&#34; bits, but they barely stick out of the chuck. They still work, but use the 2&#34; bits instead. Any bit with a hex end can be used.To use the screwdriver, hold it in its initial position, press the trigger, and within two seconds after the LED ready lights on, turn your hand either clockwise or counter-clockwise. The gyroscope senses the movement and automatically turns the bit. The speed depends on how far you move your hand in the direction. A less than 45 degree turn is slow, and a full 90 degree turn is fast. There are varying speeds along the way.GRIP: The grip on the handle is rubber, so it is comfortable and grips well. The trigger is hard plastic, but I would have preferred some rubber on the trigger itself. It's not uncomfortable though. I have medium-sized hands and can grip the handle perfectly and comfortably. But vertically, when the tool is upright, the base of the screwdriver barely reaches the bottom of my hand since the handle is only 2.75&#34; tall (where the hand wraps around the handle/trigger). But this is only when holding it in the 90 degree position (L shape/upright position). when it is straightened, it's no problem. And it is comfortable to hold with two hands where one hand holds the top shaft and the other on the handle.

This limited lifetime warranty excludes abuse, batteries, chargers, switches, electronics and normal wear and tear. Rechargeable batteries, chargers, switches and electronics have a two (2) year warranty with proof of purchase.\"Note 3: It's a work light: It's good for lighting up whatever is 3 to 20 feet away. It does not throw a concentrated beam; it does a poor job lighting up distant objects.Note 4: NiCd battery: In addition to weight, self-discharge, and memory effect issues, the following applies: a.) \"Several charge and discharge cycles may be needed to achieve full battery capacity.\"  b.) \"A small leakage of liquid from the battery cells can occur under extreme usage or temperature conditions. This does not necessarily indicate a failure. [ &lt;--Really, not a failure??!! ] However, if the outer case seal is broken and the chemical leakage gets on your skin...Any liquid chemical must be flushed off the skin with a generous amount of water. Brush any dry or powdered chemicals thoroughly, before flushing the area with profuse amounts of water.\"Note 5: The included Steady Charger (works off 12v DC or 120v AC) is not a smart charger. It can't tell you if the battery has reached a full charge, because it has no idea. You're supposed to just trickle charge your Knucklehead 24x7 as a tribute to energy waste. If you remove the Knucklehead from the charger, the red light will stop shining as way of confirming the obvious: The Knucklehead is not in the charger. However, the wall wart (transformer plug) will continue to radiate heat (waste electricity) and the Knucklehead's primitive NiCd battery will self discharge at a rate of maybe 20% per month. This is to be expected from a $30 flashlight sold at Wal-Mart or a state-of-the-art flashlight circa 1990. Not today's $140 flashlight.Note 6: Not very ergonomic: No show stoppers, just little things. It's not very comfortable when hand held. The battery latch is a pain to open. The AA battery adapter is a slight pain to open. The markings for AA battery direction are hard to see. You can't switch to moonlight without enduring the strobe mode for 6 seconds. The charger's bright red pilot light (which tells you nothing) could be an eyesore in a dark room.

They couldn't have gone with a common 1/8\"?Note 7: Super-strong magnet: 135 pound pull strength. Really? To hold up a flashlight? Or is this about affirming my manhood? It's a pinch hazard, a painted surface hazard, a pacemaker hazard...and who knows what it will do to your smartphone or camera?Note 8: Owner's manual: a.) very small font.  b.) Vague about what's included (Fast Charger is not included, but manual describes it as if it is.) c.) Gives very few specifications (but lots of specs are available at Streamline's Web site.) d.)

I put this bulb in one.  The unnatural light emitted from the led fixture is hideous.  I am a cook.  Part of being a GOOD cook is to have good presentation with good color.  This light will change your food to something unrecognizable, and unappetizing.  I moved it so that it is in the can over the dish-rack and it is still hideous.  My cabinets, which are an off white show up as green.  The light, as I said, appears blue.

I spent years working in buildings where you had little choice except to bring in your OWN incandescent lamp - and most people don't have that option.  The Good Thing about the LED bulbs vs. fluorescent is the LED bulbs are probably safer.  The majority of fluorescent bulbs end up in a land fill.  Why?  Because most people are NOT going to carefully package their fluorescent tubes/bulbs and mail them back to the mfg for 'recycling'.  OR carefully drape haz-mat tape around their living room when a lamp falls off the table and breaks on the carpet and then call the Mercury Removal Service.  (But the expense will be minimal!!!  Sure.  Right.  You betcha! No problemo!)  They'll take up your old carpeting (and dump it in a land-fill ;->) and you get to replace it!  But you wanted to redecorate anyway, right?.  All this and more Jobs too!  The current (and the last) administration would take credit for creating jobs in the booming Mercury Removal Industry!

It's great for keeping it still, but this sucker is a back killer to move around.This saw can't make a cut when placed at a 45 right miter and 45 left bevel - a tab sticking up from the left fence is too high and doesn't allow the saw to move.The laser is a tad narrow, and doesn't go a full 1/8\" for most blade kerfs.There's no detent override.It makes a mess with sawdust.  The collection port is really high, and the bag is angled downwards, so when it becomes over full it'll drop a big clump of dust if the saw is lowered when not running.The deck is 4-1/4\" high.  This is taller than some miter saw bench support brackets, and may become an issue.Side supports arms are not included, unlike most lower-end saws.Something that's a little silly is that unless the digital readout is turned on, the laser can't be turned on.  The readout resets itself to zero every time it's shut off and turned back on, so unless the saw is set back to 0's, the display will be incorrect, though it can be reset.Overall, it's the best saw for stationary work, unless you're a workout junkie and want something heavy to lug around instead of joining a gym.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "01 23, 2008", "summary": "Great saw"}

I used the General brand cutters for several years and was never really able to get consistently straight cuts with them, but the Ridgid work so good that the General cutters now just stay in the shop.  These Ridgid cutters cut very clean and straight and the ratcheting action is smooth and positive. With the General cutter, I sometimes had to assist them through the last click of the cut by pressing down on the top of the blade with my thumb to engage the final tooth of the ratchet. The Ridgid cutters on the other hand, will complete the cut from start to finish without any additional assistance on my part.The cutters are well made and feel very solid in your hand. The blade is replaceable without having to dissemble the tool or remove any screws. You just remove the center pin which is held in place with an O-ring. There is a notch on the back of the blade that I find can be used for reaming and deburring plastic pipe in a pinch. The internal handle lock on these actually works and keeps the cutters securely closed when you drop them into your tool bag or bucket. The external locking ring on the General's would often slip off and allow the cutters to pop open in your bag, leaving the sharp blade exposed. From my own experience, ratcheting pipe cutters have made installation of small diameter PVC pipe and conduit a lot faster and easier over the years. Before they were around I normally used a Lenox PVC hand saw or a cordless reciprosaw to cut PVC pipe.

The standard (cheap) pocket door hardware can easily bind up, especially after it jumps the track and damages the track in the process.  The biggest problem in a pocket door retrofit application is removing the old track and replacing it with a new track because it is almost impossible to reach into the door opening to remove all of the old track attachement screws and then attach the new track with new mounting holes.  I solved this problem by cutting a retangular access hole in the drywall near the end of the track where I couldn't otherwise reach.  I chose to cut on the side of the door that would need the least amount of repair and repair expertise or otherwise would show any repair imperfections the least.  In two rooms, there was wallpaper so after I patched the wall, I simply applied a new strip of wallpaper for an invisible repair.  In another room, that I was completely renovating, I had the patch and the rest of the drywall textured (by a professional who knew how to do a good job.)  Another patch was behind the kitchen refrigerator and completely hidden by kitchen cabinetry.  I could have also chosen to cut the wall in a closet that backed up to this door.  As noted by another, this hardware cannot jump the track and the doors operate very smoothly.  It is easy to adjuse the roller mechanisms to square up the door with the door frame.  One should expect that the door molding will have to be removed and replaced on both sides of the door to both remove the old door and track and to install or replace the door.  I replaced the old, beat up, molding at the same time which really looked nice.  While I was there, I replaced the DOOR as well.  The old ones were the smooth-sided brown mahogany type.  New, 6 panel, doors are cheap and readily available at your local big box hardware store and really update an older home.  I also purchased new sliding door locking hardware.  The end result looks great and works great.  I'm looking at this hardware again for a garage application.  I'd like to hang a tool holding pegboard, about 2' x 4', from this track.  The track would be mounted in front of some shelves with the track allowing me to move the pegboard out of the way if I needed access to the shelves behind.

I was able to eliminate 95% of the rattling by adding/placing dots of rubber material here and there.

Most LED bulbs for household use are very directional, that is to say the light goes in more of a beam than the glow in all directions of a traditional frosted glass bulb.  This one comes very close to being omnidirectional.  I found a version in a color temperature (2700 Kelvin) that is closer to the warm white of a tungsten filament or halogen capsule filament bulb.Note: The listed example is color temperature 5000 K, and the higher the number, the more blue-white it looks. In a home environment the blue-white color can seem harsh, sort of like an old fluorescent light tube.The light output of the 2700K example under review is 800 lumens, about the same as a CFL or incandescent rated at 60 watts.  Power consumption of the LED array is just 9.5 watts at 120 volts. This unit is said to be dimmable, but I have it in a conventional hooded desk lamp so that feature has not been tested.Two things are curious about this bulb -- the outer \"glass\" is coated in clear plastic like a shatterproof industrial shop bulb. It is sticky to the touch, and in an exposed lamp the surface might be attractive to dust.  The other characteristic is that the vertical flanges seen between the metal base and the frosted glass run quite hot for a 9 watt bulb.  It feels more like how hot a 60 watt bulb would get.  Those flanges are designed to dissipate heat created by the LEDs as they produce light, and I have to assume it gets hot, thermally, as a normal running condition.One other characteristic to note -- the bulb is about a half-inch longer than a traditional incandescent bulb. See customer photo. It should fit in most fixtures.I am delighted to see on the packaging that this bulb is \"assembled in U.S.A.\"  There is no country of origin on the bulb itself, but that's me being a skeptic.The heat issue is significant, which is why I've marked it at 4-stars instead of five.  With the heat concentrated near the socket, some sockets could eventually suffer damage from prolonged temperatures that were not envisioned with bulbs where most of the heat was up in the glass and away from the electrical contacts.  In my application, the bulb is horizontal rather than upright (base down, glass up), and the metal shroud on my lamp may aggravate the amount of heat that can build up.  But so far, in the first hour of operation, the metal shroud is COOLER than with the 40 watt halogen it replaced.----------UPDATEI have improved the rating to 5-star after observing that the section between the metal base and the flanges is acting as a thermal insulator.  The flange area gets quite warm -- too hot to touch, really -- but the heat does not spread to the base.  So, there is less basis for concern about potential damage to the electrical socket into which this bulb is placed.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "03 23, 2013", "summary": "Finally - a glow instead of a spotlight"}

The Stanley TR-250 Sharp-Shooter Plus works very well for these types of jobs.The all-metal drive channel ensures better penetration, with less force to squeeze and more driving power. The heavy duty aircraft-aluminum housing is engineered for long-lasting durability. There is a Hi/Lo power lever for hard and soft materials and the flush-nose design solves the problem of stapling in tight spots, with a lock-down handle for safe storage. Designed into this tool is a quick-view window which simplifies staple identification and an easy-slide full-stick staple load, uses Stanley Sharp-Shooter TRA700 series or Arrow T-50 heavy duty narrow crown staples 1/4-Inch (6mm), 5/16-Inch (8mm), 3/8-Inch (10mm), -Inch (12mm), 9/16-Inch (14mm) and 1/2-Inch (12mm), 9/16-Inch (14mm), and 5/8-Inch (15mm) Brads. There is an internal wire guide function that can be controlled with your thumb ( control function for not driving staple into wires in error), palm control function to control your staples and brads, and with a 30-percent easier squeezing function your hand doesn't get as tired as with other harder to squeeze staplers.Some of the product features are:* Easy-squeeze product works overtime as a staple gun, brad nailer, cable tacker, and wire tacker* All-metal drive channel ensures better penetration* Less force to squeeze and more driving power* Heavy duty aircraft-aluminum housing for long-lasting durability.* Hi/Lo power lever for hard and soft materials.* Flush-nose design solves the problem of stapling in tight spots* Limited Lifetime WarrantyStanley makes a heavy duty staple assortment for different uses around the house TRA700BN and has 5/8-Inch (15mm) brads included. You can order, go to your local home improvement big box store, or hardware store where you will find refills for your needs. These are common and easy to find so you shouldn't have trouble finding them. It is important to use the correct staple for the job, as the problem of the staple not embedding completely in different wood types maybe the staple and not the gun.I've have good luck with this particular staple gun for my home needs and would recommend it for light to moderate home use. This staple gun does require some hand and wrist strength, so if you have some problems with this, due to arthritis or tendon strength, you may have to use a different type of staple gun. The Stanley TR-250 Sharp-Shooter Plus is made in Taiwan.Stanley warrants this product to the original purchaser for its useful life against deficiencies in material and workmanship.

What I received was far from it.  When received from FEDEX I looked at it and said \"Damn, I can put this together in about 5 minutes\".  Not so, very poor quality control on the product that they shipped out.  It was suppose to have 6 space washers, it came with 4 (the parts list initially said four and was crossed out and updated to six).  The wheels were suppose to simply slide on the axel (one did, one didn't).  The cotter pins seem to come in two different sizes, three long, one short.  Seeing that one of the wheels slides fine on either end of the axel, I can only assume that the bearing race on one wheel, was either the incorrect one or out of round. So, I thought maybe it was just a metalic burr, which could be easily corrected with a rubber mallet (used gently of course).  Nope, seems I had to place it in a vice and use a drift pin to knock out the axel, which also knocked out the inner bearing race.  This created another problem, \"reinstalling the race with the bearing intact\".  Way to much crap to go through for no particular reason.  Sigh . . .This happened on a Saturaday night so there was no one to call, although I did have use for this product at this time, I guess I just place everying thing on hold or buy a mule.  So . . . now it's sitting in my garage anxiously waiting for Monday to come about.  Seeing that I have a few options, other than calling the company and expecting them to \"overnight\" the correct parts (which I doubt), I will probably be returning the product to Amazon \"if\" what I get is \"static\" from Harper.  I will, however, edit this fine review if the company handles this in a expedient manner and update the rating, if not . . .well I did rate it one, didn't I?  So . . .I guess time will tell.Update:  March 10,2010  I eventually had to return the first one for a same product replacement.  And I was impressed with the expedient manner Amazon handled the return and sent me another one (that worked).  Long story made short, all the parts fit this time, however there were still two space washers missing as in the first order.  That ok, I figured this could possibly happen and I saved two spacers on the hand truck I returned.  I would have probably given this product a five star rating if part one of this review never happened.As far as the assembled product is concerned.  It only took a few minutes to put together.  Removing the handle to convert it to a four wheel truck is easily done with just two pins that lock into place.

Within a few minutes, I was talking with a well informed support rep who told me not to worry and that the control was a capacitive type.  It would work with the fan, he said.  I took his word for it and opened the package and hooked it up.  BOOM!  It worked right away without issue.I know it's just a fan controller, but it is in my family room and it really makes the house look more up-to-date being there.  There's some cool functions with a lights-out timer and restoring to the last dimness/fan speed with a single press.  Double tap to go full speed no matter what state it's in.In my case, there was plenty of room in the canopy for the remote, I didn't have to fight it much at all to install.If I had one suggestion for improvement it would be that they should make the led's not flicker as much (hard to notice for most, probably).  But it's not very bothersome so don't let that turn you off of this great fan controller.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "02 5, 2013", "summary": "NOT a solid state controller - instead it's capacitive.

Over time, the savings you realize should pay for the cost of the product.There are times when you don&#8217;t need to use a full tank of water to flush the toilet.  On those occasions, Tap-n-Flush can reduce the amount of water that is used, by using an electronically controlled weight, to shorten the normal flushing cycle.  The option to use the full amount of water always remains available, but can also be adjusted to save water.Since I have old lift rod type toilets, when I was contacted about reviewing the Tap-n-Flush converter, I was intrigued at the possibility of being able to reduce water consumption, but was unsure if the device would work on such &#8220;ancient&#8221; technology.  Jeff at Tap-n-Flush assured me that it would, so I decided to try it out.With a minimal knowledge of plumbing, I was a little intimidated when I first opened the box, as the tray inside was filled with numerous plastic and metal parts.  There was actually no cause for concern however, because only a few of the parts were actually required to successfully retrofit my particular type of toilet.  Amazingly, the conversion process took only about 10 minutes, and required no tools!I had no idea that there were so many different kinds of plumbing systems for toilets.  The Tap-n-Flush is intended as a &#8220;universal&#8221; product, compatible with wide variety of these systems, which is why it comes with so many parts.  Fortunately the system comes with a great set of comprehensive and well written instructions.  There are a couple of booklets covering the various types of toilets, with extremely helpful diagrams that show what needs to be done.The Tap-n-Flush system consists of three basic components, a control unit, a weight, and a unit that releases a chain attached to the weight.  For a lift rod type toilet, the weight is attached to the lift rod, and placed near the rubber plug at the bottom of the tank.  The weight controller hangs on the inside of the tank, above the plug.  A ribbon wire runs between the weight controller, and the battery powered control unit, which is supposed to be placed on the top cover of the toilet tank.  Since I have cleaning stuff on the top of my toilet, I used double stick tape, and attached the controller to the wall.The system has to be &#8220;calibrated&#8221; to your particular type of toilet, by conducting a series of test flushes.  To get the best results, I found that I needed to add an extra metal disc to the weight, but after that, I was pretty much set.  Pressing the top cover of the control unit activates the system, and results in a reduction of water usage of about 30% per flush.  Since the tank in my toilet holds a lot more water than more modern toilets, the savings using Tap-n-Flush are quite significant.Other reviewers can speak to how well the device works with other types of toilet systems, but if you have an old lift rod type toilet, the Tap-n-Flush system definitely works.  The instructions are clear, and comprehensive, and even with minimal skills, installation should be simple.I have a few suggestions for improving this product.  Since the space on top the toilet may not be always available, there should be other provisions for mounting the control unit.  Besides the double stick tape method I used, mounting ears for screwing the unit the wall, would be one solution.  In some cases, the ribbon wire may not be long enough, so the manufacturer might want to lengthen it a bit.With an ability to be installed on a variety of toilet systems, nearly everyone can realize a reduction in water usage, by properly installing the Tap-n-Flush system.  The device is easily removable if you do change your residence, so both renters as well as home owners, should seriously consider this product.  It occasionally drops in price, which would be a good time to get one.", "overall": 5.0, "reviewTime": "04 19, 2014", "summary": "you owe it to yourself to check out this fantastic product&#8230;"}

Whiteside", "helpful": [123, 123], "unixReviewTime": 1386547200, "reviewText": "I'll start with a brief background of this saw (DWE7491RS) and it's fellow mates, the 7480 and the 7490X.  These units appear to be late 2013 upgraded replacements to the previously successful 744 and 745 series saws.  Upgraded specifications from the previous series are a 4,800RPM no-load blade speed (from 3,850RPM), a larger dust port (2-1/2\" vs 2-1/4\"), slightly heavier weight and for the 7491, an improved rolling stand system with integrated tool & safety accessory storage.  Most interesting to me, the 7490X and 7491RS series feature an improved fence system that has pushed the industry limits of contractor saws past the 24-1/2 inch barrier.Aside from the aforementioned upgrades, most of the other specifications (like cut depths) are identical to the previous 744/745 series.  The least expensive model, the 7480, is no longer crippled like the 745 was...even the least model has a 24-1/2\" fence to rip sheet goods in half.  Both the 7490X and 7491RS can accept dado blades, but Dewalt does now say on the 7480 that dado blades are \"not recommended.\"  The new series also seem to carry a heftier price tag at the moment, but the money does seem put to good use.  The trusted rack & pinion fence adjustment is still present, so your fence will remain true through heavy use.The new models seem to have similar differentiation as the previous series and the deciding factors are fairly straight forward based on your needs.  If you want a basic 24-1/2 rip capacity saw with no stand, the 7480 is your choice.  If you want to improve your rip capacity to 28-1/2\" and have a stationary (but still portable) integrated stand, the 7490X is your choice.  If you want maximum portability in a rolling stand, along with an impressive 32-1/2\" rip capacity and a bonus fully integrated system storage, you go with the 7491RS series.Some would say that 24-1/2\" rip capacity is all that's needed.  It's true that you can rip the short side of a 48\" sheet good, but it means you would have a fair amount of material hanging off to the left side of the blade.  You can't do it alone, that's pretty well a fact.  The improved fence system solves just this problem and provides adequate material support where it's needed.  It features two positions for the fence, which can be moved outward to accommodate the large 32-1/2\" capacity.  The measurement scale accommodates both fence positions with one starting at 0\" and the other at 8\" and out of the box, it was pretty close to accurate.  (See usage update below.)  I have noticed that the fence material support bracket is less strong at the maximum distance, but it doesn't seem to make a major difference since it's really only for basic material support.I never used the previous model of rolling stand (744 series), but comparatively I think this one is a bit easier to manipulate from what I saw of YouTube videos.  Although the saw and stand are fairly heavy assembled, getting it from storage/rolling position to operating position (and back) is a safe, easy and quick process.  It might present a challenge for shorter/lighter folks, but it's easy for me with average height and weight.  Once in place, the saw is sturdy as a rock...no problems with movement and it's not side heavy in any particular direction.  I also liked that the handle can be positioned in two ways...compact (for tighter storage) and easy-to-carry.Assembly was really quite simple and the instructions/diagrams are clear, it took maybe an hour to assemble and a bit after that to learn the major adjustments and perform blade checks so I could get started.  All your common adjustments are found within easy reach and I found that calibration adjustments I wanted to make were quite easy to perform.  It's great to have all your safety gear completely integrated into the stand, everything has a place and it's less like for safety gear to be misplaced or unused entirely.  The saw features a no-fail recessed power-on button with a large stop that could be easily kneed or kicked in an emergent situation.  There's basically no way this thing could inadvertently turn on, but as always, it's best to practice power-off safety when working directly with the blade.  The riving knife accessories are super easy to install or remove, which means I'll probably end up using it in most cases!My biggest gripes at the moment are due to a lack of accessories.  I've read that the older series dado inserts aren't a 100% match and fit fairly loose in these new saws.  Sure enough, Dewalt doesn't list any accessories available for this particular saw as of this moment...so that's probably not a preferred path right now.  (No infeed or side supports either.)  I'm betting this will change at some point in the future.  You can use a generic adjustable roller stand (or custom built outfeed table) and DIY dado/zero clearance plates in the mean time.  I thought about taking away a star for that, but with workable solutions right now, it's not a big deal for me.  Also, the provided miter guage is not really practical, but anyone who's semi-serious in outfitting their saw is going to build/buy a decent crosscut sled and a miter sled anyway.Overall, with the increased power and larger fence system, this particular unit is starting to approach cabinet saw capabilities.  It's by no means an absolute replacement, but it's certainly more capable than the predecessors and competitors offerings.  If you're like me and you want the capacity of a cabinet saw, but the need for storage/portability triumphs above all...then this unit is definitely something you should look at.  Yes, it commands the highest price of common portable contractor saws on the market right now, but it's money well spent if the increased fence capacity and refined portability is worth it to you.  As they say...buy once, cry once.I'll update this review when I've had a chance to run various materials through it, but initial performance is great.  I tried both soft woods (pine, fir) without any incident and I could definitely notice the power upgrade for the hard woods (tried walnut, cherry & QS oak so far).  I got nice, clean cuts and quick measurements across the fence were accurate enough for me.  As with pretty much any saw, the provided blade is sufficient for rough cuts...but you'll want 60/80 tooth 10\" blades for any fine work.  I have a couple cabinets to mill down and build in the immediate future, so I'll certainly be putting this saw through a workout of it's advertised capabilities over the next few weeks.Usage update:  I've used the saw for quite a few hours now, so I have a pretty good feel for the shortcomings and limitations.* It cuts everything I've thrown at it like butter.  I found some 8/4 cherry to try and although it slowed her down more than I'd seen, she chewed through it just fine.  I think it could easily take on a 12/4 piece with enough time and patience.  I am also loving that large fence and use it more often than I anticipated already...it's been awesome to easily cut larger panels easily.  I can only comfortably cut 4'x4' panels on my own, but I did do a 6'x4' panel in two cuts without too much trouble.  (One rough, one final.)  Anything larger (and especially full sheet cross cuts) and you'll need help or a decent infeed/outfeed system.  Do be aware that when you push this saw hard, it will draw more than 15 amps and can trip fuses/breakers that are rated at that level or less.  I use a vacuum switch with a 15 amp fuse and it trips when I push it hard...if I didn't have that, my breaker would likely blow.* I mentioned in my original review that the table top was \"flat as could be.\"  Well, according to my dial gauge and straight edge, there is a slope of about .015\" across the width of the table.  This doesn't have any significant impacts as far as I can tell, as long as your blade is 90 degrees (or the desired bevel setting) to that slope.  Also, I'm not thrilled with the tabletop or coating.  Upon building my panel and cross cut sleds, I found it would fairly easily rub off with even the lightest friction.  (It didn't take long at all to get that \"used\" look.)  It's also not at all ferrous, so no attaching magnets...probably to save weight since actual metal is, umm, heavy.  Plan on using using clamps if needed to secure things, both regular and miter slot as desired.* Upon a full tune-up/settings check, my fence distance gauge was off by over .015\".  No big deal and an easy fix, but I was having trouble getting even close to precision for some cuts off the gauge.  Also, my fence was off parallel to the miter slot at position 2 by almost .010\" front to back.  Probably not enough to cause problems with most cuts or rough work, but too much for my preferences.  Also an easy fix, but it did take some fussing to get it \"just right.\"  The arbor and fence at position 1 were close enough to perfect.  It was a little irritating to have to tweak a new saw into perfection, but it wasn't too difficult and is probably due to the primary market for this saw being rough work, not cabinet grade.  If you're going for precision, you may need to adjust from the factory.  I recommend a quality try or combo square, a shop made fence measuring jig (or an A-Line It jig) and a digital or analog caliper for determining error rates.* I found that my 60+ tooth fine blades require me to remove the dust shroud in order to remove the blade.  An inconvenience and it adds about 1 minute to the process, but not that big of a deal unless you're constantly changing blades.* Total dust collection is a mystery until Dewalt does something.  At least if you rely on a Shop Vac and 2-1/2\" hose.  The 2-1/2\" port is solid, no problem, and catches most dust.  But, a fair bit of dust kicks up as usual...which is why they designed the riving knife with integrated dust chute.  Awesome option, but absolutely ludicrous to plumb for at this time, making the accessory virtually worthless.  There is no 2-1/2\"x1-1/4\" Y adapter out there and I'm not going to use 5+ fittings, convert to 4\" and add a bunch of extra hose to do it.  I find the normal fallout with the regular knife preferable to shooting it six feet across the room.* Some quick things that are hard to find about this saw. It takes up to a 8\" sized dado blade, up to 13/16\" in width.  (I haven't used a 6\" dado, but an 8\" worked fine...I can imagine a 6\" would work with less max depth.)  The working table top height is 36-3/8\".  Maximum storage height is about 44-3/4\" with the handle in compact position or just over 48\" in easy-carry position.  There's a lot of mis-info in the Q&A; here and even from the manufacturer, these measurements are from my actual 7491RS saw.  Feel free to comment if you want other fairly precise measurements.  Accessories for this saw will start rolling out Q1 of 2014, with a dado plate being the first anticipated accessory to roll out from Dewalt.Other than those things, I still think it's an excellent saw.  Maybe 4.5 stars would be my actual rating due to the from-the-factory adjustments I had to make and my disappointment with the table top.  Other than that, it's been comfortable to use and work with and is giving me great results and perfect joints.

Drew \"Anaal Nathra/Uthe vas Bethod...", "helpful": [5, 5], "unixReviewTime": 1356566400, "reviewText": "I own a bunch of electronic tape measures - collected several over the years. Most recently it's been laser instead of sonic. The inexpensive (comparatively) audio / sonic models are under $100. The laser models can cost upwards of $400 for every feature under the sun (Bluetooth and more), while models that do more than you'll probably ever need cost $150-$300. All manufacturers of laser distance measurers offer a few models - and all price the same. The lower the price, the shorter the distance and the fewer the features. Stanley offers three models - 330 feet, 165 feet and 100 feet.  These distances are in ideal conditions. Dust, bright light and even high humidity can effect this. So if you're planning on usually measuring towards the high end of a range, say 95 - 100 feet, then you should purchase the next model up - or more.  I have the 330 foot version of the Stanley and the Bosch GLR825. The Bosch goes to 800 feet.I'll compare the top Bosch model to the top Stanley model, as I own and use them both.Power: Staney uses 2 AAA batteries, the Bosch 4 AAARange: Stanley 330 feet, Bosch 800 feet (they do have models with less range)Cost: Bosch is $100 moreWeatherproofing: Stanley - claims to be weatherproffed, but there's no gasket on the battery door. There's actually a opening by the clip. Bosch, weather proofed, including a gasket on the battery door.  I don't know if the less expensive Bosch models are weatherproofed.Size: Stanley is about the size of a pack of cigarettes. Bosch is about twice the bulk (it's thicker, wider and longer) and 3x the weight.Display: Both have multi-line backlit displays, although the Bosch is about 25% largerAccuracy: Both boast 1mm accuracy over the full rangeIf you're a home-owner, carpenter, painter, carpet layer, etc. this is the ideal distance measurer - even pros will appreciate it, as long as you don't use it in really wet conditions. 330 feet is plenty for most people. Rain can effect the accuracy, so for most people this is not an issue. You can also \"chain\" measurements, say 200'+200'+300' and so on.One feature I like about these devices is the \"advanced\" math they do for you - OK, it's basic math for many of us, but it's a real time saver. Area, volume, SQFT, angles, indirect measurements, min-max and more. You could calculate paint and carpet requirements for a room with only a few button presses.All of these devices share one flaw - the person pressing the button. If the laser is at even a slight angle, the distance can change by fractions to inches. This is where the max/min comes in handy. For example, measuring from wall to wall, you want the minimum.  If the laser tilts up or down and / or side to side, the distance changes. You also may not be holding it level and perpendicular - so you purposely wiggle it a little and use the min value. Many pros will use these on a leveled tripod - there's a 1/4-20 standard tripod mounting hole.The included CD contains the 20 page owner's manual. I'd rather have a printed version. There is a really nice fold-out quick reference that fits in the included carry pouch.  The reasons I gave it four instead of five stars: no gasket on the battery door, no printed manual, backlight is always on.I tested this model side by side with my Bosch and both were accurate. I was not very scientific, and I noticed after the fact that the optics have different set-backs. So even though I aligned the fronts, that was not a fair side by side test.I'd confidently use either model. I had the Bosch first - purchased it because I planned on measuring a lot of exterior distances and wanted that 800 foot range. Found out that in daylight you really need a 2nd person with a reflector for best results. It's easier at dusk when you can see the laser dot. Now that I also have the Stanley, I find the Bosch is overkill for me.  But the next time I need to map out a building, I can hand one of these to my assistant and do it that much faster.", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "12 27, 2012", "summary": "Compact, light, accurate - but only partially water resistant"}

I bought this nailer to install Hardieboards on my house.  This tool saved me a huge amount of time over a hammer.However, I am not a pro and here is what I found challenging:1.  The depth gauge was fairly easy to use but after a while I found that I had to just nail in a course and quickly hammer the nails home.  Call it user inexperience (which clearly was the case) but I ended up under-driving rather than over-driving on purpose.2.  If you don't watch the plastic nail strap or cut it off frequently, it could twist around and foul the tool, requiring a stop to fix it.3.  It comes with the \"automatic\" trigger function: Hold the trigger, push, and nails will pop out until you let go.  I found that difficult to work with: I can see how that would be useful for roofing, but for Hardie Boards, it made me pay too much attention to trigger pull/release, rather than paying attention to quality work.Why 4 stars and not 5: Because the single-trip (one pull, one nail) mechanism doesn't come with the tool.  I had to order that from a Hitachi dealer (referred by Hitachi themselves when I called) and it cost an additional $60-$70.  Porter Cable, for example, will provide a different trip mechanism for free for their finish nailers (or at least they did when I bought one).

Mostly though this has been used to check the flow of lines to residential properties to ensure lines are not hot before the crew goes into the houses to start their work. Over the years I've come to be very cautious and not trusting, just because it says it's off doesn't mean it is. Granted most times that's true but for that one in a few thousand times it doesn't hurt to double check all the other times to ensure that no one gets hurt.The amprobe works great for outdoor use as it will squelch pretty loud when it detect power. also when it's on it has a beep every so many seconds to let you know that it is still functioning which I find to be a rather nice feature. The controls are really straight forward and easy to understand. Just hit the bottom for the type of power you want to test and go to town. When in doubt just go from the higher to the lower. As long as you can get withing an inch or 2 of where the wires are you will know for certain if their is power flowing or not.This has helped in finding line damage as well all we had to was walk along the line until the squelch was no longer occurring. Easy peasy really. the only thing I would like better for this is if it didn't use 9V batteries.

When my wife got the chance to review one for Vine I was thrilled.  After using it a couple of time it turns out my initial impression was pretty close.  Our big project this weekend was to use it do a cutout for the heating register in the  inch laminate flooring we helped my daughter and her husband install.  The tool did the job, but not without some problems.  I think the  inch laminate was too much for the tool/bit.  I was using the TR561 Multi-purpose bit and halfway through the first cut the bit broke.  It was having a hard time going through the material and I was pushing too hard.  I also had the depth set deeper than it need to be.  New bit, less depth and less pressure and I was able to finish it fine, although the last third or so of the cut was really slow going.  I don't know if the laminate was dulling the bit or fouling it, but there was a lot of smoke the last 6 inches.  The next thing we tried it for was to cut a notch.  We cut the two side cuts with a straight saw and then tried to do the inside cut with the Trio.  Broke the bit again.  With all of these cuts I used some sort of guide to run the tool along.  With the register cut it was a 2x4 I keeled on.  With the notch I tried the side fence.  It is very difficult to use this thing free hand.  I was not able to do it, although I am by no means a wood worker.Pros:- Well designed, comfortable tool.- Kit includes a great case with spots for everything including bits and the manual.- The kit includes a side fence, which can also be used to cut circles (which I haven't tried).- Because the tool is small and easy to handle you can use it on projects where you would not be able to use a router.- Adjustable depth, mar-proof foot.Cons:- No two ways about it, this is a router and you have to use it as such.- Bits have a shaft diameter that is different from other Dremel tools (and my router).", "overall": 4.0, "reviewTime": "08 29, 2010", "summary": "Dremel Trio Review"}

I do wish the rubber contact switch tip provided more of an extention to it so I could bite it to hold to use hands free when needed on certain job situations.This Streamlight arrived and right out of the package had good alkaline batteries, the switch worked great unlike I'd read in a couple other reviews.I always sleep with a penlight clipped to the collar of my sleep wear so in an emergency there's no delay seeing in darkness and this light is so bright could be used also to temporarily blind an intruder too.I would not recommmend constantly turning the switch on/ off as I'd suspect that would lead to a malfuntion.This has an easy momentary on/ off touch but as long as this is NOT carried in pants pocket it shouldn't be a worry about depleting the batteries.I do like the momentery touch when it's needed.This does come with a cordura type sheat and a spare rubber cap if the cap does wear through.PLEASE NOTE: when unscrewing the cap to replace batteries, the clip WILL immmediately scratch through the black finish.I would highly recommend this light as I've used pen lights for many years, so far this light has worked great and very bright.

I discovered why they cut the log on the short side before the longer based side; if you don't have enough weight then the saw & logs weight will let the spike hold free dropping the log.  Watch your toes.Item of concern was the brasses that hold up the top part would come disconnected as you bump the unit while loading the log.  The smallest logs 2-3&#34; were the hardest to wedge in for cutting and to feed the 9+&#34; logs through the opening took some effort.All in all this is a helpful tool if you have to work alone.

I do agree with one reviewer who complained that tools catch on the plastic backing along the top row when pulling them out and the plastic should be extended to the bottom of the tool pocket, however, knowing this I don't put tools that catch on the plastic backing in the upper row.  I am now at the point where I \"know\" where all of the tools are and I can reach for them without looking and get what I need.

My kids had a lot of fun playing music and having the bulb flicker in time to the music; and my daughter saw it could be made pink and immediately wanted it for her room. So, the novelty of it has value.However, the execution is not there. I downloaded the iOS app and it is a hodgepodge of bad design ideas burying interesting features. For example, it's fun to play music and have a light show. However, the lamp itself isn't quite up to the task of changing its brightness or color fast enough to keep up with any reasonable tempo. Also, the act of picking music is clumsy especially if much of your music library is in the cloud; I know people think Coverflows are cool but they are not an efficient means to get through a song library of thousands of pieces.I dislike apps which put up alerts  of the form \"Are you sure you want to leave this view without saving your settings.\" This is just disruptive to the flow of using an app and shows a lack of user experience judgement.While Bluetooth LE is a great technology with many uses, it is likely WiFi would have been more useful. As it is, I have to be close to the lamp to control its settings.As for the lamp itself, it isn't particularly bright even when in its default warm white mode. I wish it pumped out a few more lumens.
